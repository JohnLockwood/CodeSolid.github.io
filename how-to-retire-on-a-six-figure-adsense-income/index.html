            <h1>How to Retire on a Six Figure AdSense Income</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">26 Mar 2008</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>If you were lured to this post by the title, you shouldn&#39;t feel bad.  I didn&#39;t really write this title to trick you, though I did write it to make a point.  I&#39;m actually going to show you how to do it by the end of the article, too, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to accuse me of trickery.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you don&#39;t already have a web site, and you&#39;re starting from scratch.  Six figure retirement means our goal is simply to get to $100,000 in AdSense income per year.  This shouldn&#39;t be hard.  Just this morning, I stumbled on this article with the unambitious little title, <a href="http://www.mediaups.com/2008/03/25/become-the-next-advertising-millionaire/">Becoming the Next Advertising Millionaire</a>.</p>

<p>This is going to be so easy.  The &quot;next&quot; advertising millionaire.  Wow, there must be thousands of them!</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m Just Like You</strong></p>

<p>I like to think that I&#39;m too intelligent to fall for the siren song of Internet riches, but I&#39;m not.  I want to be an Internet advertising rock star just as much as the next guy.</p>

<p>As a result, lately I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time with AdSense and other ad networks.  This is how I happened to stumble on the &quot;Becoming the Next Advertising Millionaire&quot; article.  I found it during a search for &quot;interstitial ads&quot;.  I visited one of my main blogs today, and found that suddenly there was another web site there, and it was making Firefox crash.  As it turns out, an interstitial ad is an ad where a whole new web site comes up instead of yours, with a link or two that says &quot;Sponsored by <Your Website Name>&quot;.  An ad network I was trying out, AdBrite, leaves these &quot;full page ads&quot; on by default, though you can turn it off.  When I searched for &quot;AdBrite&quot; and the company that was there in place of my site, I learned about &quot;interstitial ads&quot;.</p>

<p>Now you know about them, too.  Wow, you&#39;re going to be so filthy rich.</p>

<p><strong>Back to Our Six Figure Goal</strong></p>

<p>In my case I didn&#39;t start on the road to AdSense wealth from scratch.  I have about 3,400 pages of web content under my belt, so I get to play around.</p>

<p>One site of mine has 610 pages of blog, and about another 400 pages or so on top of that.  We&#39;re going to use the blog number of 610 pages since that&#39;s where I&#39;m running AdSense.  Over the past ten days AdSense reports 2,461 page impressions, and I&#39;m making $2.38 per 1,000 impressions.  My average for all my sites is $2.80 per 1,000 impressions, so we&#39;ll use that for now.</p>

<p>Having 2,461 impressions in 10 days means I&#39;m serving up 246.1 impressions per day. There are 610 pages on the blog overall, so that means that each page gets displayed 246.1 / 610 times per day.  Dividing, each page gets displayed .40 times per day.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to be rich in no time.  Stay with me.</p>

<p>We get $2.80 per 1,000 page views.  A page of content gets displayed 2.48 times per day.  Our goal is to reach $100,000 per year.</p>

<p>OK, $100,000 per year divided by the $2.80 we get per thousand page views means we need to have 35,714 x 1,000 page views per year to make $100,000.  That works out to 35,714,000 page views per year.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, let&#39;s assume you can write four pages per day, five days per week, on average, and you&#39;re going to start when you&#39;re twenty-one years old.  Fifty-two weeks in a year times twenty posts per week is 1,040 pages per year.  Each page gets viewed .40 times per day, so that means you can generate about 147.25 page views in a year.  Our goal to get to $100,000 in yearly AdSense income is 35,714,000 page views, so let&#39;s see how old we&#39;ll be when we retire.  35,714,000 divided by 147.25 is 245,539, so starting out when you&#39;re twenty-one, you&#39;ll be in a position to earn your six figure AdSense retirement when you&#39;re only 245,518 years old.</p>

<p>If I were you I&#39;d start typing.</p>
