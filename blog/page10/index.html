  <b><a href="/second-crack-at-verbatim-strings-w-wordpress-code-markup-plugin">Using the Wordpress Code Markup Plugin</a></b><br />1 July 2006<br />
  Well, I just found Bennet&#39;s excellent <a href="http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/code-markup-wordpress-plugin/">Code Markup Plugin</a>, and with it, I was able to pretty quickly fix the post about C Sharp Verbatim Strings.

  <b><a href="/visual-studio-arrived">Visual Studio Arrived</a></b><br />1 July 2006<br />
  Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it&#39;s installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn&#39;t Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0—Application Development Foundation</a>, which I was planning to take anyway.  Pretty cool.

  <b><a href="/c-verbatim-strings-3">C# Verbatim Strings</a></b><br />29 June 2006<br />
  Just doing a bit of hacking with the C Sharp mono compiler this evening.  (I&#39;m waiting for Visual Studio to ship -- what else?).  Meantime I may have found my first error in Donis Marshall&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=sacramentorea-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0735621810%2Fqid%3D1151639146%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Programming Microsoft Visual C# 2005:  The Language</a> -- which doesn&#39;t bode incredibly well given that I&#39;m only on page 23 or so.

  <b><a href="/net-contract-in-sacramento-going-well">.NET Contract in Sacramento Going Well</a></b><br />28 June 2006<br />
  The ASP.NET contract I&#39;m doing in Sac is going quite well so far.  It&#39;s a small and really congenial team, and in less than a week I started to make some good progress on some of the code.

  <b><a href="/aspnet-20-programming-hooray-new-gig">ASP.NET 2.0 Programming: Hooray, New Gig!</a></b><br />24 June 2006<br />
  I&#39;m grateful to my good friends at Robert Half for the exciting gig we&#39;re working on now, developing in ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005.  I&#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.

  My HP d4100e arrived while I was at a &quot;Zoo Overnighter&quot; with my daughter, so naturally I was excited to see the big cardboard box in the living room when I returned, a sign of impending hardware.

  <b><a href="/more-on-ruby-programming">More on Ruby Programming</a></b><br />23 May 2006<br />
  I&#39;ve been digging a little more into Ruby, and I definitely get what the excitement is about.  As a few authors have said, Ruby strikes one as <a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/xml_matters_18.html">Perl done right</a>.   I loved PERL, even when it was done wrong, so needless to say I&#39;m really having a blast in Ruby.

  Of course, now that I&#39;m brushing off my software hat -- a four-prop beanie, presumably -- I&#39;m opening Dr. Dobb&#39;s Journal when it comes in the mail.  The lastest edition talks about the buzz surrounding Ruby on Rails.

  <b><a href="/programming-in-sacramento">Programming in Sacramento</a></b><br />17 May 2006<br />
  Well, it&#39;s time to order a nice speedy computer so we can load it up with the sort of slow software that people will pay you to work on.  Interestingly enough, functional open source works great for the self-employed, but to work in the software you have to have at least a grudging aquaintance with some bloated commercial apps.

  <b><a href="/seven-deadly-reciprocal-linking-sins">Seven Deadly Reciprocal Linking Sins</a></b><br />23 April 2006<br />
  After every major Google update, it seems, someone will come out with a new obituary, announcing the death of reciprocal linking.  And it&#39;s true that in recent years, Google seems to have downplayed reciprocal linking in their algorithm.  Yet for all of that, reciprocal linking is alive and well.
