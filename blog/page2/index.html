  <b><a href="/pros-and-cons-of-test-driven-development">Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development</a></b><br />13 May 2013<br />
  If you ask anyone who works with me, I&#39;m a huge fan of automated unit testing in general and Test Driven Development (TDD) in particular. Ever since I first tried it out on a project eleven years ago, I&#39;ve been convinced that Test Driven Development is a huge improvement over the number one software development &quot;methodology&quot; in the U.S.: code and fix.

  <b><a href="/troubleshooting-passenger-and-devise-problems-on-ruby-on-rails">Troubleshooting Passenger and Devise Problems on Ruby on Rails</a></b><br />11 July 2012<br />
  I spent more time than I&#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.
