  <b><a href="/web-design-and-being-in-a-state-of-flow">Web Design and Being in a State of Flow</a></b><br />21 June 2011<br />
  For someone who considers himself skeptical and rational, I&#39;m a huge fan of self help books.  Naturally, given my skeptical and rational bent, my taste in such books leans heavily toward those that either really are somewhat scientific or at least make a pretense of being that way.

  <b><a href="/css3-and-modern-web-design-resources-this-week">CSS3 and Modern Web Design Resources This WeekRecursos Para CSS y Diseño Web Moderno Esta Semana</a></b><br />15 June 2010<br />
  I&#39;ve been preparing for a tutorial series that I will write soon that will start with a blank screen in a text editor and finish with a complete modern CSS3 web site layout.  I might also include a bilingual Wordpress and / or Drupal theme, depending on how ambitious I&#39;m feeling once I&#39;m well into it.  In preparation, I&#39;ve been perusing several websites to think about what sorts of things I would like to include. I&#39;ll post a follow-up to this article outlining the work we&#39;ll be doing in the tutorial, but meantime, I thought I&#39;d share some of the resources I found, which are excellent.

  <b><a href="/my-first-bilingual-web-site">My First Bilingual Web SiteMi Primer Sitio Web Bilingüe</a></b><br />12 June 2010<br />
  Over the last few days I have been working on adding support for bilingual blogging to ParticleWave.com.  Today I am very happy to be writing my first bilingual article.  For this first article, I am writing the the translation into Spanish by myself -- just ask any native Spanish speaker!  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left one or two errors in the <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/blog/es/2010/06/12/my-first-bilingual-web-site/">Spanish version</a>, but maybe I can ask one of my friends to clean it up a little for me.  Oh, by the way, in case you missed it, the links to switch between languages are located at the top of the page.

  <b><a href="/the-unimaginable">The Unimaginable</a></b><br />29 May 2010<br />
  Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.

  <b><a href="/facebook-privacy-concerns">Facebook Privacy Concerns</a></b><br />28 May 2010<br />
  Lately the well publicized quitting of Facebook by many Google empoyees and others over privacy issues has struck me as rather funny. OK, exactly what state secrets do you have on Facebook that would be a huge problem if someone found out? You like the movie Avatar? You play basketball? Yep, I could get your bank account information easily with that data. Your name? Make one up if you&#39;re paranoid. Your birthday? Likewise.

  <b><a href="/knee-jerk-open-source-ialism">Knee Jerk Open Source-ialism</a></b><br />1 November 2009<br />
  I have a few conservative friends. I can&#39;t help it. I live in El Dorado County, not Berkeley. One of my conservative friends who I haven&#39;t seen in a few years used to say that his quarrel with liberals was that they had a lot of knee-jerk ideas. A search for &quot;knee jerk liberal&quot; returns 431,000 Google results, while &quot;knee jerk conservative&quot; returns only 408,000, which proves (scientifically, of course) that liberals have 5.6% more knees than conservatives.
