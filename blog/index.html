  <b><a href="/we-are-moving">We are moving</a></b><br />1 June 2014<br />
  For some time now my ParticleWave site has been fairly schizophrenic, being also JohnLockwood.com and Codesolid.com.

To add to the lack of mental health around this site, I&#39;ve been meaning to move the whole site to Jekyll for some time,
because I&#39;m tired of wordpress updates and stupid spam comments.  In other words, I&#39;m moving from Wordpress to Jekyll for the same reason 
everybody moves from Wordpress to Jekyll.

As of this post, my site is live on Github pages, as you can see if you&#39;re reading it.

There was a LOT involved in making the move, and I took lousy notes.  So this is not a tutorial, or not much of one -- sorry.  It&#39;s more of an announcement for the one or two people who are kind enough to read me from time to time.   Getting Wordpress to Jekyll was one nasty little bit of business which I have forgotten since I did it weeks ago.  I do recall that it started with Google and involved typing, so I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re smart you can reproduce it.  More recently I&#39;m able to credit David Ensinger&#39;s <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/">fine article</a> on how to workaround the fact that your plugins are likely not supported by Github.  Nice job there and helpful,
and my own stripped down version of his Rakefile is in the <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/tree/source">source for this site</a>.  My version
works around some issues I had (I found I had to force the pushes to master for some reason), and it removes some of the sass-specific stuff he had added 
since I&#39;m not using sass at the moment.

Most importantly, it&#39;s nice to have a starter site here I can begin to build out.  You&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a lot to be done, the pages are just stubs, etc., etc.  There&#39;s no domain actually pointing here yet, though we&#39;ll work on having it be CodeSolid.com before too long.

And now finally I have a place for the blog posts to go, so I can keep writing.  For about two months I&#39;ve written very little on ParticleWave since I know it&#39;s going away.

Now I can feed my keyboard addition again.

  <b><a href="/testing-the-rake-post-task">Testing the Rake Post Task</a></b><br />1 June 2014<br />
  I just merged some tasks from Ellen Gummesson&#39;s cool Rake Boilerplate, and once that was done, started this post based on nothing
more complex than &#39;rake[&quot;Testing the Rake Post Task&quot;]&#39;.

Very cool.  Nice job, Ellen, and thanks.

My Rakefile with David Ensinger&#39;s work on building Jekyll sites locally and working around the fact that Github doesn&#39;t support most plugins, together with some of Ellen&#39;s post-creating magic is located <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/blob/source/Rakefile">here</a>.

  If you&#39;ve taken a look at the <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials">Github Repository</a> for the CodeSolid tutorials, you may have noticed that the project files all use IntelliJ Idea.  I use the Ultimate Edition (currently Version 12) for most of my development, but recently I promised to look into using these project files in Eclipse.  I had a feeling it would work since I have sourced the Maven project -- i.e., the POM files, those named pom.xml in the root of each tutorial -- but being the good test infected developer that I am, I try not to take &quot;that should work&quot; for granted.

  <b><a href="/spring-unit-testing-using-junit">Spring Unit Testing Using JUnit</a></b><br />16 May 2013<br />
  The Spring Framework provides special JUnit test runners to make acquiring and testing an ApplicationContext really easy to do.  We'll show you how to take advantage of these special test runners to do basic Spring Unit testing.  We'll also teach you how to acquire an application context without using these runners, and though we'll demonstrate this using JUnit as well, the same techniques can be used in Standalone Spring applications or in other test frameworks like TestNG.  <a href="/spring-unit-testing-using-junit">Read more</a>...

  If you ask anyone who works with me, I&#39;m a huge fan of automated unit testing in general and Test Driven Development (TDD) in particular. Ever since I first tried it out on a project eleven years ago, I&#39;ve been convinced that Test Driven Development is a huge improvement over the number one software development &quot;methodology&quot; in the U.S.: code and fix.
