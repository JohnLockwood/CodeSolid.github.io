  <b><a href="/how-to-run-the-codesolid-tutorials-in-eclipse">How to Run the CodeSolid Tutorials in Eclipse</a></b><br />17 May 2013<br />
  If you&#39;ve taken a look at the <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials">Github Repository</a> for the CodeSolid tutorials, you may have noticed that the project files all use IntelliJ Idea.  I use the Ultimate Edition (currently Version 12) for most of my development, but recently I promised to look into using these project files in Eclipse.  I had a feeling it would work since I have sourced the Maven project -- i.e., the POM files, those named pom.xml in the root of each tutorial -- but being the good test infected developer that I am, I try not to take &quot;that should work&quot; for granted.

  <b><a href="/spring-unit-testing-using-junit">Spring Unit Testing Using JUnit</a></b><br />16 May 2013<br />
  The Spring Framework provides special JUnit test runners to make acquiring and testing an ApplicationContext really easy to do.  We'll show you how to take advantage of these special test runners to do basic Spring Unit testing.  We'll also teach you how to acquire an application context without using these runners, and though we'll demonstrate this using JUnit as well, the same techniques can be used in Standalone Spring applications or in other test frameworks like TestNG.  <a href="/spring-unit-testing-using-junit">Read more</a>...

  <b><a href="/pros-and-cons-of-test-driven-development">Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development</a></b><br />13 May 2013<br />
  If you ask anyone who works with me, I&#39;m a huge fan of automated unit testing in general and Test Driven Development (TDD) in particular. Ever since I first tried it out on a project eleven years ago, I&#39;ve been convinced that Test Driven Development is a huge improvement over the number one software development &quot;methodology&quot; in the U.S.: code and fix.
