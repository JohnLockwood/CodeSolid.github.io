  <b><a href="/getting-started-with-typo-2">Getting Started With Typo</a></b><br />12 July 2012<br />
  Why do Rails developers like me blog on WordPress, which is written in PHP, instead of Typo, which is written in Ruby on Rails?

  <b><a href="/troubleshooting-passenger-and-devise-problems-on-ruby-on-rails">Troubleshooting Passenger and Devise Problems on Ruby on Rails</a></b><br />11 July 2012<br />
  I spent more time than I&#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.

  <b><a href="/testing-devise-authentication-in-rails-3-1">Testing Devise Authentication in Rails 3.1</a></b><br />6 July 2012<br />
  I ran into a bit of a hiccup while writing tests in RSpec for a site I&#39;m working on which is using Devise for authentication.  I spent a short time working through the documentation at <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Controllers-and-Views-tests-with-Rails-3-(and-rspec">testing Devise using rspec and controller tests</a>), only to end up stubbing my toe on the following caveat:

  I work in a Microsoft shop during the day working mostly on legacy code written in C, C++, C#, and some VB.NET. There was an incident at work recently that turned me into a Rails Contractor, through some interesting alchemy involving pointy hair, which I will describe below.

  I buy too much crap.  The chances are pretty good that you do, too.  Actually, the chances are even better that you&#39;re a spambot, but let&#39;s leave to one side the issue of my low readership for now.  If you&#39;re here as a human denizen of the interwebs, you probably buy about as much crap as I do.

  I just installed the <a href="http://thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/code-markup-wordpress-plugin/">Code Markup Plugin</a> and thought I&#39;d give it a bit of a test drive.  Some HTML and PHP ought to be enough to prove the concept, I would think:

  <b><a href="/taking-another-look-at-python">Taking Another Look At Python</a></b><br />4 February 2012<br />
  The first few times I encountered Python was in a local bookstore, and I think the same book was there each time.  Each time I was immediately put off by this unfortunate volume, which seemed to suggest that the greatest thing about Python was the whitespace, and gave me the impression that whitespace was more significant than it was.

  <b><a href="/back-into-rails">Back into Rails</a></b><br />7 January 2012<br />
  I haven&#39;t wanted to really dig into a software language in a long time, but I&#39;ve been brushing up my Ruby and Rails skills and enjoying it thoroughly. It&#39;s still fun even if I only get to do it in my spare time. I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of making money at it yet, and currently I make a living digging up dinosaur bones in what we will charitably call C++ since that&#39;s what the file extensions seem to denote.
