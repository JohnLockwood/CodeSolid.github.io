<div class="post">
<p>We&#39;ve written about landing page optimization before. Traditionally, folks running a pay per click campaign were very interested in making sure they&#39;re converting as many visitors as possible. However, even if you&#39;re blogging, you should not ignore the fact that you are, at the end of the day, working to make a sale, not just to have your head appear on as many social networks as possible (though we&#39;ll get to that in a minute, too). This week we uncovered the article, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/09/ten-tips-for-lead-generation-landing-pages/">Ten Tips for Lead Generation Landing Pages</a>, which is especially relevant to real estate marketing.</p>

<p>With the recent changes in the Google <a href="http://www.soloseo.com/tools/indexRank.html">page rank</a> of many major web sites, many people are wondering if there are other indicators of a web site&#39;s importance that are somehow &quot;better&quot; than PR. One of the tools I came across this week in this context was Solo SEO&#39;s <a href="http://www.soloseo.com/tools/indexRank.html">IndexRank tool</a>. IndexRank is a measure of how fast a site is growing, based on how many pages are indexed over a period of time.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/04/reductio-ad-myspace/">wrote about Ning</a> earlier in the week, taking a bit of a critical view of the idea of a social network for everything, everyone. Later in the week however I had to hurry up and head over to Cre8Buzz after getting a nice invitation from Metrowest&#39;s <a href="http://activerain.com/blogs/metrowesthomes">Bill Gassett</a>, one of our first active readers here on ParticleWave. Let me pass that invitation along to all you real estate professionals, come <a href="http://www.cre8buzz.com/real_estate/signup_now">sign up at Cre8Buzz</a>.</p>

<p>Now that you&#39;re done buzzing, get ready to learn about Web Analytics and SEO. Analytics is the subject of Justin Cutroni&#39;s excellent blog focusing on Google Web Analytics, <a href="http://www.epikone.com/blog/">Analytics Talk</a>. On the SEO front, Original Signal has put together the RSS feeds for several outstanding SEO sites into a single resource, <a href="http://seo.originalsignal.com/">Broadcasting SEO</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, you may need some pretty pictures for your blog. I personally like the big selection of photos that are more or less a buck at IStockphoto.com, but when it absolutely positively has to be free, check out these <a href="http://www.public-domain-photos.com/">public domain photos</a> and this list of <a href="http://pstutorialsblog.com/44/free-stock-photos/">free / cheap photo web sites</a>.</p>
