          <h2>The Two Best Times to Do Real Estate Key Word Research</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Nov 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For a short time I had a bit of a widget installed here that would let me chat with people. One gentleman who struck up a conversation was in the beginning phases of writing a blog for San Jose Real Estate. I felt a fair bit of sympathy for him, since it seemed to me he definitely had his work cut out for him. I had researched San Jose as a possible topic of a real estate web site some time ago, and ended up rejecting it as being too ambitious.</p>

<p><strong>New Projects, Research Main Keywords</strong></p>

<p>I believe that the first ideal time when you absolutely must do keyword research is when launching a new web site or blog. Some keywords are simply far too competitive. For example, querying &quot;intitle:San Jose Real Estate&quot; gives over 7 million results! By just looking at some of the nearby areas we may be able to come up with something much more manageable. The query &quot;intitle:Santa Clara real estate&quot;, for example, yields a far less daunting 241,000 results. Sure, you&#39;d still have your work cut out for you to compete for that keyword, but by comparison, going after San Jose is rather like getting into a prize fight with a heavyweight champ.</p>

<p>Sure, you can change your title later on, but the reason it&#39;s so important to do keyword research at the outset of a project is that if you&#39;re writing good content and networking with your peers like you should, chances are good you&#39;re going to start attracting a few incoming links to your blog, and chances are a few of these folks will use the title in their link text -- which is a good thing (unless you overdo it). So you want to try to get it right up front.</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing Projects -- Strive For Depth of Focus</strong></p>

<p>The other best time to do real estate keyword research besides whenever you&#39;re starting a new project is really three ideal times in one: morning, noon and night! Well, OK, maybe not night -- you do have to save some time for watching Stephen Colbert. My point is, you have an opportunity with every article you write to capture a topic that a reader may be interested in. One of my agents, Purva Brown, recently discovered the power of this when she got a client from an article she wrote about Crosswoods Condos. Such &quot;obscure&quot; keywords are often called &quot;long tail&quot; search keywords (after the shape of the curve drawn by the many thousands of non-core keywords buyers may reach your site for). These long-tail keywords have several important characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is less competition for them. This means an article about such a topic has a good chance of getting a high placement on the search engines.</li>
<li>There are fewer people searching for them (individually). Because of this, they&#39;re inappropriate as the focus of a whole web site, but perfect for a single article.</li>
<li>Collectively, they can account for a huge portion of your site&#39;s traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because there are fewer people searching for long tail keywords, they&#39;re difficult or impossible to turn up with traditional key word suggestion tools like <a href="http://wordtracker.com/?roia=!YzY5OQBVAAAZVkEAAj33">Wordtracker</a> (see also their <a href="http://affiliate.wordtracker.com/r/699/a/146935/l/bg73b1">free keyword tool</a>) or <a href="http://inventory.overture.com">Overture</a>.</p>

<p>However, brainstorming long tail keywords works quite well. Think about how people search for homes, and where they might want to live. Try combinations of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subdivision names.</li>
<li>Neighborhood names.</li>
<li>Parks or other recreation facilities. Sports arenas? Theaters?</li>
<li>Schools or school districts.</li>
<li>Names of Builders.</li>
<li>Other local place names.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often just adding &quot;real estate&quot; to your main place name will do the trick, but for things like school districts you might even try suggesting a radius. &quot;Homes near Mount Vernon High School&quot; or the like.</p>
