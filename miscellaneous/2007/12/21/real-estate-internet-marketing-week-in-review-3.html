          <h2>Real Estate Internet Marketing Week in Review</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This week I finally published the video <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/20/windows-live-writer-tutorial/">Windows Live Writer Tutorial</a> that I&#39;ve been meaning to do for some time.   This tutorial goes through getting up and running, but I didn&#39;t yet get into some of the really neat Live Writer features that would make you want to get up and running.  As a supplement to my tutorial in the meantime you might check out some of the other reviews and articles out there.  Phil Waineright&#39;s <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=199">Writer is Microsoft&#39;s first Live Killer App</a> has an older (but still good) overview of the features -- and Live Writer now supports tags, which was missing when he wrote that post.  Paul Stamatiou also wrote an excellent <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/08/14/review-windows-live-writer-beta/">Live Writer Review</a> with several screen shots based on the beta.  Paul also mentions a few of the drawbacks of the software that I hadn&#39;t noticed.  Finally, Michael Pick has produced an excellent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY6gf5aa93E">Windows Live Writer Video Review</a> -- which shows among other things that I need to work on my Camtasia to Youtube skills (no, I don&#39;t think I will link to my Youtube video -- that&#39;s the point).</p>

<p>Aside from Live Writer goodies, the other news is that it is almost Christmas, which means it&#39;s also almost New Years, so it&#39;s time to start thinking about things like business planning and goal setting.  There are only about two shopping days left to participate in DailyBlogTips&#39;s Group Writing Project, <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/group-writing-project-2008-blogging-goals/">2008 Blogging Goals</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I installed a new theme for this site earlier this week, ParticleWave_01, a custom theme I designed recently.  One of the items on what&#39;s getting to be a rather long ParticleWave &quot;to do list&quot; is to make a version of that theme available.</p>
