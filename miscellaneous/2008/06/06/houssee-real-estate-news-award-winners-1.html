<p>Do you dig real estate, yet find yourself homeless on Digg?  <a href="http://www.houssee.com">Houssee.com</a> is a Digg-like site for Real Estate news.  We welcome submissions from bloggers from their personal blogs, or from their social network blogs such as ActiveRain, RealTown, RealEstateWebmasters, etc., etc.  We also love to have links to other real estate news stories you may have encountered from online news sources.</p>

<p>Houssee.com is also the sponsor of the Houssee award, which features the top user-voted stories each week.  ParticleWave gets the honor of hosting this first ever Houssee award.  So here then are the stories that either got the most votes or were otherwise outstanding in their category.</p>

<p><strong>And The Oscar Houssee Goes To...</strong></p>

<p>In General Real Estate News, first prize for the top voted post this week goes to Gig Harbor&#39;s Matt Thompson for his Reconnect to Your Community link to his <a href="http://gigharborundressed.neighborhoodsundressed.com/2008/04/28/good-to-tour-gig-harbor-again/">Good To Tour Gig Harbour Again</a>, a beautiful and well illustrated post that does an outstanding job of highlighting his community.</p>

<p>The Market News and Updates categories had no published news, and I&#39;ll recuse myself from pointing to my own posts and zero in on Purva Brown&#39;s thought-provoking <a href="http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com/2008/01/will-investors-save-sacramento-market.html">Will Investors Save the Sacramento Market</a>?   Mitch Argon&#39;s monthly update on <a href="http://www.freenevadamove.com/blog/mitch/northern-nevada-home-sold-statistics-may-2008/show/">Reno Home Sales Statistics</a> would have been the top vote getter in that category, but it was filed under general.</p>

<p>The Investing category award goes to user PhoenixMarketTrends for an excellent article on whether owning <a href="http://www.phoenixmarkettrends.com/public/item/198854">Is Owning an Apartment Buliding Right for You</a>, which goes into the pros and cons of the larger multi-unit investments.</p>

<p>The Mortgage category didn&#39;t garner any votes yet, so I&#39;ll just have to pick an article, won&#39;t I?  OK, I pick the one that I highlighted, <a href="http://blownmortgage.com/2008/06/03/massachusetts-sues-hr-block-over-mortgages-to-minorities/">Massachusetts Sues H&amp;R Block over Mortgages to Minorities</a>.</p>

<p>Fans of Trulia voted heavily for <a href="http://www.truliablog.com/2008/06/03/win-your-golden-ticket-for-the-inman-real-estate-connect/">Tell Us Your Trulia Voices Success Story -- Win a Ticket To Inman Connect</a>, giving us a clear winner in the Real Estate Internet Marketing Category.</p>

<p>With a single entry in the Listing Announcements category, Matt Thompson scores a second Houssee this week for a <a href="http://gigharborundressed.neighborhoodsundressed.com/2008/04/16/rare-gig-harbor-waterfront-property/">Rare Gig Harbor Waterfront Property</a>, with an honorable mention to Susan Hilton&#39;s cool post about custom <a href="http://thecenturytreereader.com/2008/06/04/home-with-a-view-treehouse-what-is-in-your-backyard/">Treehouses</a> -- ok, ok, they&#39;re not listings, it&#39;s just a fun post.</p>

<p>Finally, in the About Houssee.com / Winners Category, where we feature the post that did the most to spread the word about Houssee.com, our clear winner was a post by Jay Thompson, the <a href="http://www.phoenixrealestateguy.com">Phoenix Real Estate Guy</a>, entitled <a href="http://agentgenius.com/?p=2059#comment-10571">Houssee.com, a Digg-like Site for Real Estate Info</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Submit Your Posts and Win Fame, Links, and Pictures of Valuable Shirts</strong></p>

<p>So what you should do is go over and <a href="http://www.houssee.com/register.php">sign up</a> so you can start <a href="http://www.houssee.com/submit.php">submitting your posts</a> and voting for your favorite news stories right away.   Please make sure to check out the categories and submit your post to the most appropriate one -- there&#39;s more competition in the &quot;General News&quot; category.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/housee-teeshirt.gif"><img src="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/housee-teeshirt-thumb.gif" alt="housee_teeshirt"></a>OK, so you&#39;re thinking, &quot;Wow, this one post is the start of an awesome tradition.  If I act now, I can be practically in on the ground floor of the Houssee phenomenon!&quot;   I don&#39;t blame you a bit for thinking that.  It&#39;s very perceptive.</p>

<p>Just by submitting a story, every Houssee submitter is guaranteed a real honest-in-goodness link.  We&#39;re not talking about a creepy nofollow link, either, or something that goes through Javascript and then links to you after phoning our European allies to ask for permission.  We&#39;re talking genuine link love, baby, the way God and Tim Berners Lee intended.</p>

<p>Plus, if you win a Houssee during one of our (weekly?  occasional?) Houssee award posts, you get yet another link from the award, which will be posted on one of the many fine Houssee hosts we have in mind.  (OK, sure, they&#39;re all different blogs that I write -- but when I run out of those I&#39;ll think of something.)</p>

<p><strong>What Else Do You Get?</strong></p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more!</p>

<p>If you win a Houssee, you&#39;re entitled to <a href="http://www.houssee.com/shirt.html">proudly display</a> this picture of a 100% cotton tee shirt.  This is not a picture of some cheesy cotton polyester tee shirt.  This is a nice shirt, with double-secret half stitches and reinforced upseams.  This picture is only available through this exclusive Internet offer.</p>

<p>Congratulations to all our intrepid posters and hard working winners this week.  Come check us out.</p>

<p>Submit early.  Vote often!</p>
