          <h2>Promote Your Real Estate Blog on Houssee.com</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jun 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I am pleased to announce that ParticleWave has just launched <a href="http://www.houssee.com">Houssee.com</a>, a web site where you can submit and vote for your favorite real estate articles.</p>

<p>I launched Houssee.com because I enjoyed using RealEstateVoices.com, but as I mention in a <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/05/29/a-review-of-realestatevoicescom/">recent review</a>, I felt it had a bit too much Spam to succeed in the long run.</p>

<p>The mission of Houssee.com is to be a promotional tool for Realtors®, mortgage brokers, and others in the real estate blogging community, while putting systems and strong moderation in place to keep out the spam. (What&#39;s the definition of spam? Well, it&#39;s everything that&#39;s not somehow directly related to real estate. Yes, Realtors® often have laptops, and the laptops often need batteries -- but your laptop battery ad is spam.)</p>

<p>As time goes on we&#39;ll have further announcements about Houssee.com and how you can make the most of it to help you get content read.</p>

<p><strong>Top Contributors Will Be Featured</strong></p>

<p>Within a few days I should have a section on the home page featuring the top six or so contributors. To encourage you to start publishing your stories, the &quot;top contributor&quot; will be the person who submits the most real estate stories, whether or not the stories are published. (As the site takes off I may reward other aspects of contributing, such as publishing stories that get good votes, or voting for others&#39; stories, etc.)</p>

<p>If you have comments or suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment here.</p>
