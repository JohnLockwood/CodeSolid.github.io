          <h2>What's Your Internet Marketing Strategy -- Author's Guide</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Jan 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Have you been successful in your real estate or lending career largely (or partially) because of your Internet marketing?   Our &quot;What&#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&quot; series (see our <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/">announcement</a>) highlights authors who are using the Internet to close more business.  You don&#39;t have to have an &quot;Internet-only&quot; marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we&#39;ll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we&#39;re looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.</p>

<p>Guest authors of course will have their own byline and appropriate links in their article.  (I recommend no more than five self-serving links, and no more than eight links overall).  If you&#39;re interested in contributing, please <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/contact/">contact me</a> and let&#39;s discuss it.</p>

<p>This article goes into some questions and guidelines that may be helpful to you as a guest author in our &quot;What&#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&quot; series.  You don&#39;t have to answer any particular questions an certainly not all of them, but you may find that going over the list will help you to come up with ideas to round out your article:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How important is the Internet to your overall marketing plan?  Is it the only kind of marketing you do, or is it just one of many strategies?</p></li>
<li><p>What percentage of your business can you trace to Internet marketing?</p></li>
<li><p>What companies have helped you with your Internet marketing?</p></li>
<li><p>What role if any does your personal web site(s) play in your marketing strategy?</p></li>
<li><p>What role if any does your blog (s) in your marketing strategy?</p></li>
<li><p>Which of the following (if any) have been important to you?</p>

<li>Pay per click advertising.</li>
<li>Other traffic generation (banner ads, directories, etc).</li>
<li>Pay for lead services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do you use social networking services (if at all)?  Social networking services include ActiveRain, Facebook, LinkedIn, Myspace, etc., etc.</p></li>
<li><p>How many closed transactions can you trace back directly to social networking services?</p></li>
<li><p>How important are having online listings to your strategy?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have visitors register for listings?</p></li>
<li><p>What types of leads does your web site generate?  Which of these have you had the most success at closing?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you consider the strengths of your online marketing program?  What do you think could be improved?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you do in the way of short-term follow-up?  How fast do you respond to your leads on average?</p></li>
<li><p>What types of long-term follow-up systems do you have?  Do you do any drip marketing other than sending listings (a newsletter, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>How cost effective is Internet marketing compared to other forms of marketing you&#39;ve done?</p></li>
