<p class="meta">16 Jul 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>It&#39;s been a few weeks since we&#39;ve done a Houssee Award article anywhere, so I thought I&#39;d discuss why in the context of my experiences in launching this yet-another-Digg-clone real estate site.</p>

<p>The discussion is fabulously short, really, and my experience boils down to having too high an expectation for what would happen. The premise of the site was that the community of real estate authors would visit the site and vote on their favorite content, and those votes would be the basis of the award.</p>

<p>As it unfolded, however, very few people were interested in reading or promoting content that wasn&#39;t their own. A few folks did, and I&#39;m grateful to those who did. But the vast majority of users were only interested in promoting their own content. That&#39;s fine, such as it is. It&#39;s certainly one of the reasons Digg based sites are so popular. But as it turned out, there weren&#39;t enough people interested in anyone else&#39;s content to sustain a user-voted award by any reasonable definition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that such a thing won&#39;t miraculously start to happen, and if it does, we can get the award ball rolling again. But I don&#39;t expect it to.</p>
