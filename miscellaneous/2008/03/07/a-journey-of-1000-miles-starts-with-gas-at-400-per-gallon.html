<div class="post">
<p>As you all know, this is a new blog.  I do have some other blogs that I&#39;ve been working on for some time -- the oldest since 2003.</p>

<p>Inklit is so brand new that we&#39;re still counting the articles here in single digits, and we have &quot;archives&quot; for March -- the month we&#39;re in now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly a reputation yet, it&#39;s more like an indictment.  Yet things are moving along about the same as they always do on a brand new blog.  The <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog">Feedburner feed</a> is done, and we&#39;re listed on MyBlogLog.  I was able to chat up Jennifer and get her to stop by.  That was nice.   Google has figured out that we exist and has started indexing us.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, nobody knows I&#39;m here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s either good news or bad news, depending on your point of view.  As my wife pointed out a few days ago when I complained that I didn&#39;t quite have my subject matter in hand yet, the lack of readership means I can make all the mistakes I want.  A less charitable way to say it would be this:  It doesn&#39;t matter how much I suck, because no one&#39;s reading me anyway.</p>

<p><strong>When In Doubt, Change Your Mind</strong></p>

<p>Being new in a career is a sure fire way to experience a false start or two.  One of the things I remember about my first year in real estate was how many different directions I tried before things started to click for me.  There&#39;s a lot of that going on this blog and in my new writing career as well.  For example, the post that appeared here yesterday about <a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/06/setting-writing-goals-making-room-for-the-good-stuff/">setting writing goals</a> was one that I actually wrote a bit earlier.  Now it&#39;s Friday already, so it&#39;s time for me to think about how it went this week, catch up on the unfinished tasks, and maybe report back.</p>

<p>OK, then, well here&#39;s my report, oh ye who are not yet reading me!</p>

<p>As far as production goes, my blogging production on my various blogs is at about 80% of the goal I set for myself, and I should have it up to 90% or better by the end of the day.</p>

<p>The fiction goals I set for myself, which in my earlier post I said was &quot;the good stuff&quot; I was making room for, is the one area where I have a big fat goose egg to report.  The opportunity that drove me emotionally and that also consumed most of the time this week was the PLR writing goal.  I spent well over the allotted ten hours on this goal working on setting up a shopping cart system, in the course of which I scraped my knees a few times and found out about three or four different ways that the shopping cart won&#39;t work.  Originally I&#39;d been promising my writing partner that I&#39;d have the cart up and running by Monday, but it&#39;s looking like it&#39;ll slip.</p>

<p>In miscellaneous news, I did a creditable job of keeping track of my time for the most part, though I still find I have to force myself to set my timer before I set out writing.  My output varies between about six and fifteen words per minute -- I&#39;m using 10 as a rough idea of what I can produce.</p>

<p>I do think the idea of setting the goals in writing for the week was worth doing -- and setting them somewhat aggressively was also the right approach.</p>
