          <h2>What I Learned About AdSense from Associated Content</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Mar 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>AdSense and I have a checkered past.  I had an account several years ago, but never made much from it.  Last week I decided that really ought to take another look at ad networks like AdSense, since I believe that Pro Blogger / Online Publisher is a legitimate career path for an Internet writer (albeit one with a long start-up curve and a crowded field).</p>

<p>So last week I put up some AdSense on a popular real estate blog I own, and again the results were not all that spectacular -- a couple of bucks per day.  But things got interesting soon.</p>

<p>Ask any kid with a chemistry set.  Nothing interesting happens until you mix two things together.</p>

<p><strong>Enter Associated Content</strong></p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t think that Associated Content would have much to do with AdSense on the face of it.  AdSense lets you generate ad revenue from your web site, and Associated Content is a place where you can sell writing online if you don&#39;t mind not getting paid much.</p>

<p>What tipped me off to the idea that those to things are actually not all that different was a single unifying statistic, CPM.  That&#39;s an ad term that you probably know, which means &quot;Cost per Thousand (Impressions)&quot;.  Of course as a publisher I&#39;m not interested in cost so much as revenue.  Some people call this RPM (Revenue Per Thousand).  Google uses the weird expression eCPM, or &quot;Effective Cost Per Thousand&quot;, but effective or not, we&#39;re talking about revenue here.</p>

<p>When I signed up for Associated Content, I knew the rates would probably be lower than they would be for direct writing sales.  I tried them out because I thought it would be an easy way to make a quick writing sale or two, and I wanted to see what they offered.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a report on the rates yet, because the first article I tried was submitted for up front payment review, which can take up to two weeks.  I can tell you that others have reported numbers that don&#39;t impress me much, such as <a href="http://freelancefromhome.blogspot.com/2006/12/make-money-writing-articles-online.html">$7.00 per article</a>.  Based on that, I doubt I&#39;ll be writing up a storm for them, but we&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>What really got me interested, however, was when I saw their performance payments, which is based on what they call (wait for it...) <strong>PPM</strong>, or &quot;Payment Per Thousand&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>PPM, CPM, RPM, eCPM -- How Much Money Are We Talking Here?</strong></p>

<p>What got my attention immediately about Associated Content&#39;s PPM was that it was $1.50.  My AdSense account hovers around $9.00 per day.</p>

<p>This got me thinking.  If AdSense pays about $9.00 per thousand page views, six times as much as Associated Content, maybe Associated Content would turn out to be the victor over AdSense in the Worst-Way-To-Make-Money-Online Throw Down.  Are you ready to rumble?</p>

<p>It also got me wondering about how many page views my web sites had, and what that would look like divided by 1,000 and then multiplied by $9.00!  It turns out that I may be able to make several hundred per month off of Adsense for a month&#39;s work or so, since I have a fair sized inventory of unperforming content.</p>

<p>&quot;Inventory of unperforming content&quot;.  See, I&#39;m talking like a publisher already!</p>

<p><strong>What Kind of CPM do Real Estate Brokers Make?</strong></p>

<p>As soon as I started thinking in terms of CPM, I got curious about how much money I made last year as a real estate broker from my real estate web sites.  So I did some really rough-draft calculations, and came up with a figure of somewhere between $20 to $30 per 1,000.  That&#39;s not bad considering where we are in the &quot;real estate meltdown&quot; (also known as &quot;the credit crunch&quot; or &quot;the end of carbon based life as we know it&quot;, depending on who you ask).  I could probably do $60 per 1,000 if I wanted to hop in the car more and do more sales, but of course that would be cheating.</p>

<p><strong>My Publishing Epiphany</strong></p>

<p>Some time yesterday I had a publishing epiphany, where everything I&#39;d ever written online turned into a viewable page, a 1/1000th fraction of an M that could produce some revenue value for me, some &quot;R&quot;.</p>

<p>The nice thing about thinking about RPM is that it teaches us that we as publishers can increase either our RPM (look for better publishing or ad opportunities) or our M (write more, or promote it better), and either way we&#39;ll get more R, more Revenue.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a future post we&#39;ll talk about the results of my attempting to increase RPM and continue to increase it over time using an open source Ad Server, <a href="http://www.openx.org">OpenX</a>.</p>
