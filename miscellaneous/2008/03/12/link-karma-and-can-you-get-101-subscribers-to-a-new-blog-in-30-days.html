<p>Well, you can sure give it a try!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been having great fun working on my <a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/">101 Subscribers in 30 Days</a> promotion on my new Inklit Writing Blog.</p>

<p>A lot of people have stopped by and have helped me out tremendously as I work on the program. <a href="http://www.valleymarket.com/">Wasilla RealtorÂ®, Marty Van Diest</a> came by and lit a fire under me that I know needed lighting, to allow email subscribers as well as RSS subscribers.</p>

<p>In a matter not so much related to getting 101 new subscribers in 30 days as it is to overall gratitude, <a href="http://www.4realz.net">Authentic Real Estate Engagement</a> expert, Dustin Luther, stopped by a couple of weeks ago to help me out on another issue that I needed some help with. I appreciated his visit and the support. You should check out Dustin&#39;s blog if you&#39;re a real estate agent / broker interested in taking full advantage of Web 2.0.</p>

<p><strong>Win a Six Month Ad on a New Blog</strong></p>

<p>I realize you&#39;d rather have a six month ad on Problogger, but I didn&#39;t write that one! Those of you who like contests and who don&#39;t mind taking a bit of a risk (your time only, not your gold) on a brand new venture may want to try pitching in to see if you can win a 6-month or 2-year ad at InkLit.com.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise/">Rules for the Ad Contest</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.santaclaritarealestateblog.com">Santa Clarita Real Estate Blogger, Linda Slocum</a>, went above and beyond the call first by being the only commenter on this <a href="http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html">cleverly re-titled post</a>.</p>

<p>Following up on this, she promoted the contest for me on FaceBook. I&#39;m hoping to do well there. People with their face in a book are a natural for a writing blog!</p>
