          <h2>Real Estate Blog Lab's Dave Smith on His Real Estate Internet Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Mar 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Many of our readers will recognize Dave Smith as the author of <a href="http://www.realestatebloglab.com">The Real Estate Blog Lab</a>, a very popular blog about Dave&#39;s experiments with using Wordpress.  Dave also runs several blogs for his wife, Barbara Lasky, including the <a href="http://www.tucsonazrealestateblog.com">Tucson AZ Real Estate Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.barbaralasky.com/tucson-real-estate-blog">Tucson Real Estate In the News</a>.  Tucson Real Estate In the News has propelled BarbarLasky.com into a first page position on Google, while his other blog ranks equally well on MSN.  Answering my call for guest authors to write about their <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/01/08/whats-your-internet-marketing-strategy-authors-guide">Internet Marketing Strategy</a>, Dave emailed me details on his real estate business.  These included some production statistics that Dave later asked me to delete; I hope Dave will forgive me if I let you in on the secret that they were excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Dave writes:</strong></p>

<p>About 85% of our business for 2007 came from our Internet marketing.  This is what I&#39;m in charge of doing (you probably already had that one figured out).</p>

<p>2007 was our best year yet.  Barbara has been in the business full time now for six years.  I&#39;m a newbie at just over two years, but was the database administrator for Long Realty Co. with more than 1500 agents in fifteen offices.  They have expanded since I left.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many prospect/clients we are working with currently.  I know it is quite a few.  We have two sources of business.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Past clients and referrals from them.</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet marketing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We have done more referrals this year than ever before.  We have two commercial deals closing this month with a 20% referral which will be somewhere around $2.3 million between the two of them.  These came from Internet leads from our blogs.</p>

<p>We do almost no print advertising except on our Sunday insert a few times a year.  No magazine or other media.  No mailings, nothing else except a small drip campaign:  once a month a post card goes out with a tip of some kind from Barbara&#39;s sharper agent account.</p>
