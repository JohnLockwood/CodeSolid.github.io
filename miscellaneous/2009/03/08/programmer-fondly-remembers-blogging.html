<p>Do you remember blogging?</p>

<p>I think when the history of the current economic depression is written, historians are likely to draw a parallel between the bloggers of 2007 (or thereabouts) and the flappers of the roaring twenties.</p>

<p>Do you remember blogging? Do you remember having the money to blog? That brings me to my next point: what happened to me, and why am I not blogging any more? The short answer to that is that the money started to go away, so I went and got me a day job.</p>

<p>You know: a day job, with a boss and a 401K and a W2 at the end of the year. Yikes!</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fortunate man to not be unemployed right now. I&#39;m fortunate because I&#39;m self-employed when times are good and -- so far at least, knock keyboard -- I have a day job when times are bad. In my day job I&#39;m back to my old day job of programming software using Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio. As it happens, the software I&#39;m working on in my day job is a legacy C and C++ Windows codebase. I maintain the database layer, which at times is a proprietary collection of drivers accessing Oracle, ODBC, etc., and at times is just an OLEDB connection.</p>

<p>On the weekends, when I&#39;m not spending ten minutes with my family, I&#39;m working on creating some vertical applications using more recent Microsoft technologies, ASP.NET 3.5, C Sharp 3.0, and LINQ to SQL. One might say, to paraphrase Michael Steele, that I&#39;m bringing my core programming values and applying them to &quot;<a href="http://blacksnob.com/snob_blog/2009/3/6/michael-steele-ends-hip-hop-urban-to-suburban-campaign.html">urban-suburban hip-hop settings</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>I have a Republican friend at work. Some of my best friends are Republicans. Does saying that make me a racist?</p>

<p>I apologize that I don&#39;t have more code to share here yet. I&#39;m too busy writing code to have much time to write about writing code, but I do remember blogging.</p>
