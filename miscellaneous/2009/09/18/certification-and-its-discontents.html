          <h2>Certification and Its Discontents</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Sep 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Even though I’m nowhere near finished with my study for <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/15/microsoft-exam-70-536/">70-536</a>, I’ve begun to start thinking about and working toward my next study goal, 70-562, <em>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Application Development</em>. The Self-Paced training kit came from Amazon last night, and I’ll have the subject outline up here soon and start filling it in as I’m already doing for 70-536. As I’m writing this, SQL Server 2008 Management Studio Express is installing away in the background, because as I discovered this evening, trying to get any kind of serious database scripting done inside of Visual Studio alone is like trying to program C Sharp in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa214007%28SQL.80%29.aspx">isql</a>.</p>

<p>Oh alright, it’s not that bad, but if you can’t be inaccurate using a metaphor, then what good are metaphors, anyway?</p>

<p>The next phase of our little certification pony show is likely to be a good deal more labor intensive than the first phase. The nice thing about studying for 70-536 is that it lends itself readily to sort of brain dead little “Hello World” example that I used to write twenty years ago when I was first learning to code in C. This is good for blogging in the evening after a somewhat tiring day in the procedural salt mines. The study for 70-562, in contrast, is likely to require bigger bits of code, especially if I want to get to something I can not only learn from in a quick and dirty way, but also publish.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas for how that will go, and now I have a new domain to host it on, but there’s nothing there yet.</p>

<p>I’m not all that discontent – just weary, and I thought it was a cool title, what with old Sigmund having anticipated it and all.</p>
