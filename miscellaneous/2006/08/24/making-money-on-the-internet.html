          <h2>Making Money on the Internet</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Aug 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>In my last post, I hinted that ParticleWave has been about making money on the Internet all along.</p>

<p>As Gavin DeGraw summed it up, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be anything other than what I&#39;ve been trying to be lately.&quot;  And I might add, whatever that is, the mind has a propensity to declare that that&#39;s been what it&#39;s been all along.</p>

<p>Meantime over on my Oakland Blog, I hit the zone this morning with a post about how much <a href="http://www.oakland-homes-for-sale.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/24/the-enterprise-of-blogging/">I love Walmart</a>.  You might also call that post, &quot;Confessions of an Interloper&quot; -- but if you do that, you waste a perfectly good title.</p>

<p>You know us interlopers:  We always wonder about what&#39;s in the title tag.  That&#39;s how you get to be an interloper.</p>

<p>So how do you make money on the Internet?  It&#39;s  simple, get yourself a domain, like ParticleWave, and then fool around with it in every moment of your spare time for a couple of years until you know something.  Then go off in a totally different direction, i.e., real estate, and have a head-slapping moment when you realize that some other guy in the office is being paid to be an internet interloper.  (Or internetloper, as one might say).  Then realize, &quot;Hey, you can make money on the Internets in Real Estate?  Sweet!  I&#39;ll try that approach.&quot;</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can stumble into some other way to do.  If you do, that&#39;s great.  I hope I do, to.  Actually, I don&#39;t plan to stumble.  I plan to learn, and to teach, and to succeed.</p>

<p>Why not.  What else have I got going on?</p>

<p>I will say this, though.  When I see some other articles about how easy and overnight it is, however, I want to cringe.  For me, it&#39;s been hundreds of hours of work, lots of false starts, hits and misses.  Even now, I can&#39;t say that my Internet revenue is such a big deal that I can afford to give up my &quot;brick and mortar&quot; activities.  Not that I really use brick and mortar on anything, but that&#39;s the idiom.</p>
