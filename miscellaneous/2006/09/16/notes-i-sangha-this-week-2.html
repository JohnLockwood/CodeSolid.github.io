          <h2>Notes I Sangha This Week</h2>
<p class="meta">16 Sep 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This was a good week in my Buddhist devleopment, inasmuch as I went out and met many more live two legged Buddhists than I have in the last year or more.  On Monday I was fortunate to drive somewhat quickly and arrive in time for the Dharma Practice and Teachings session at <a href="http://www.lionsroarmandala.org">Lions Roar Dharma Center</a>.  This Sangha was very friendly and welcoming and I enjoyed my visit.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I had a wonderful time sitting with a <a href="http://www.mtstream.org/sittinggroups.html">sitting group in Placerville</a>.  Chris Basiletti led a great Dharma talk after the meditation period, and there was a fun discussion afterwards that I enjoyed very much.  As if that weren&#39;t enough, we then took a break for tea, and our host provided some tea for us that seemed a lot like unconditioned tea to me.  OK, that&#39;s an exaggeration, I&#39;m sure, but it was very good tea.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I didn&#39;t get to play with any Buddhist pals, because I was holding a house open with my good friend who is a Catholic loan officer, and only one inquisitive neighbor stopped by.  Now this doesn&#39;t sound entertaining, but it really was.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday were days with a Y in them, too.</p>
