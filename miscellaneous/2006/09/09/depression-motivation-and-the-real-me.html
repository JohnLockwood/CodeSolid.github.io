          <h2>Depression, Motivation, and the Real Me</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Sep 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I recently set as a goal for myself to learn all I can about depression and motivation.  This is because I found that as I actively began to examine my life and create goals for each area (i.e., take control of my destiny), I found this process very enjoyable and anti-depressing in nature.</p>

<p>I suffer from what (I believe) is mild depression.  So no need to send the marines out or anything -- I&#39;m not going to cut my wrists with a sharp debugger or anything.</p>

<p>However, one of my first forays onto the internet brought this to light:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most insidious aspects of depression is that there is a tendency to attribute the symptoms to other factors in our lives. A lack of enjoyment, motivation or increased irritability at home may be considered to be due to a (possibly non-existent) problem with personal relationships. Similarly we may start to consider changing jobs believing that it is the external environment that is responsible when in fact it is a treatable illness affecting our interpretation of the external environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What often happens is that in looking to our environment to find the reasons for what are symptoms of an illness, we try to &#39;fix&#39; things that are not broken which can have a very real destructive impact on our lives. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis and getting the most effective treatment for you, will make an enormous difference.</p>

<p>That&#39;s from the <a href="http://www.depressionet.com.au/sod/types.html">Types of Depression</a> page over at DepressionNet.com.</p>

<p>Wow, bulls-eye.  Isn&#39;t that the story of my career over the last four years.</p>

<p>So then what can I say at this point about motivation and depression?  Not much, I&#39;m just at the beginning of my inquiry, but I do know that I seem to feel best when creating my own life rather than suffering from it.  Yet it&#39;s the same set of external circumstances either way.</p>
