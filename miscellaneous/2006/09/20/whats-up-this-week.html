          <h2>What’s Up This Week</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Sep 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>One thing that&#39;s become evident this week is that, with my efforts to re-establish a career veering off in many different directions like some series of poorly made bottle rockets, there&#39;s barely a smidgeon of rice paper or the like between charming motivated John and going back to bed.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as I&#39;m not in bed but here being at least charming if not motivated, I am, ipso fatso, Fatso.   But I&#39;d rather be that than that idiot, Ipso.</p>

<p>Meantime, my categories checkboxes tell me that this post is also designed to be about Buddhism somehow, so it&#39;s time for the weekly Sangha update, I suppose.</p>

<p>One of the meditation groups I&#39;ve been attending has turned out to be somewhat untenable.  It takes a while to find one&#39;s way around, I suspect.  The other group, which met last night again, was once again very tasty.  Next week we&#39;ll be sitting in a new hall instead of one of the member&#39;s homes.</p>

<p>I find I prosper in such meetings to the extent they&#39;re more like a group of meditators getting together, and less like a church.  It&#39;s nice that someone has robes and prostrates to the altar a multiple of three times and has other traditions -- it&#39;s just not for me.</p>
