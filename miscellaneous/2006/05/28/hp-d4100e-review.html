          <h2>HP d4100e Review</h2>
<p class="meta">28 May 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>My HP d4100e arrived while I was at a &quot;Zoo Overnighter&quot; with my daughter, so naturally I was excited to see the big cardboard box in the living room when I returned, a sign of impending hardware.</p>

<p>The good:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The unit I purchased was a dual core AMD Athlon 4200, with 2 Gb of RAM, so finally I have a substantial development box to work with here, no cheesy underpowered laptop.  So far I&#39;ve thrown the JBoss Application Server and Eclipse&#39;s Java IDE at it and it took that and 120 meg of Firefox windows in stride.  Performance has been fine, though it&#39;s interesting to note that there are some things about Windows that are just slow anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Other than start-up, which sounds like a brief and minor train wreck, operation is very quiet.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a nice set of included utilities, including PC Doctor and a bunch of junk I haven&#39;t tried out yet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The bad:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first day it was set up, with the included wireless mouse and keyboard, I had two fairly nasty hangs of the &quot;hard boot -- pull the plug&quot; variety.  I&#39;m not sure if the mouse and keyboard are really the culprits, but I thought I&#39;d replace them with my wired PS2 ergonomic keyboard and my old mouse to see what I could see.  So far since then I&#39;ve gone through a day with no hangs at all -- knock wood that&#39;s solved.   </p></li>
<li><p>Well, compared to the issue above -- which if unsolved would be a a heart-breaking call support or heaven forbid wrap it up and send it back -- nothing else is really to complain about, but the box is a bit of hefty and large.  In my younger days I&#39;d consider that a benefit, now I no longer need to play inside so I call it a defect.</p></li>
<li><p>The system came with a pre-installed 60 day trial of a version of Outlook, Outlook 2003.  No, thanks, I&#39;ll skip the upsell.  My old version serves just fine.</p></li>
</ul>
