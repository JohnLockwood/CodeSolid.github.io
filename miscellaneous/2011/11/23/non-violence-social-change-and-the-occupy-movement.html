          <h2>Non-Violence, Social Change, and the Occupy Movement</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Nov 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The animosity between the two political parties is nothing new. Likewise violence and class exploitation have been with us for a long time.</p>

<p>The Occupy Movement has been on the receiving end of a good deal of police violence – from Scott Olsen’s fractured skull. Any questions of a generation gap have been summarily answered by pepper spray, which falleth alike on eighty-four year old women and peaceful young adults at UC Davis (among many others).</p>

<p>On the Occupy side, it seems a truism that the police are the perpetrators of this violence, but I do wonder sometimes if someone like Gandhi might have counseled less arm-locking and more willingly allowing oneself to be arrested. To me it seems like a really robust and consistently non-violent position means taking a certain pity on the police to the extent of trying to not put them in the position to inflict violence. Moreover the “multiplicity of methods” that Occupy advocates, though not intended by any means to endorse violence in any form, is not the sort of thing that necessarily enforces a rigid and disciplined non-violence.</p>

<p>To give another example where non-violence might go further, does heckling political figures really advance the cause? Certainly it’s dramatic, but when I watch it happening it always looks strikes me as rude and counterproductive. This is equally true when people I would otherwise agree with are doing it as when it comes from members of the tea party. (Much as seeing this makes me uncomfortable, admittedly I’m at a loss to replace this method of gaining attention, since more genteel petition for redress seem so routinely doomed to be ignored).</p>

<p>From my position as a very sympathetic but very part time member of the movement, such kibitzing may seem like armchair quarterbacking. I do think that speaking for me, studying Gandhi’s history and reading other writers on non-violence is a very interesting endeavor that I think will help to educate me as to the possibilities.</p>
