Hi.  My name is John Lockwood, the Principal of CodeSolid Software Development, whose good fortune is fully illustrated here sitting next to my lovely wife.

I help both entrepreneurs and startups launching new ventures as well a busy software development managers who are juggling too many competing priorities to get things done.  

I have over twenty years experience, during the course of which it's been my pleasure and honor to write and ship software for Federal Express, Borland, Apple, Vision Savings Plan, and many other fine companies.

I offer reasonable hourly rates and a risk free [guarantee](/rates/) based on the first weekly invoice.  Please give me a call at (916) 359-9218 and let's get your project off to a solid start.
