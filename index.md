CodeSolid is a test automation services company located in Northern California.  We're a small but focused team of talented test automation professionals who can help you quickly move your test automation effort to completion.  We have experience in Java, .NET, Ruby, Groovy, and Python.

We have automated tests for clients and past employers using industry standard tools like JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, and RSpec. We use tools like Selenium and SoapUI to build test automation suites for web UIs and web services. We are a family owned company consisting of a senior developer with over twenty years' of software industry experience and a talented and energetic junior test engineer. 

Whether you have an team of testers and you're looking to outsource a piece of the work, or you have no testing staff at all and need some help getting started with a test plan and some test automation you can build on as you grow, give us a call at (916) 359-9218.  

Our rates are reasonable, and we love writing tests every bit as much as we despise shipping bugs.
