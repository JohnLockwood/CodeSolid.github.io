Who's Finding Your Bugs?
========================

Is it your customers?  

Well, that's one way to do it, and your competitors would love you if you did it this way all the time.

Is it your testers?  

Great, now we're getting somewhere, but your testers can probably find even more bugs if we can free them from the repetitive parts
of the test plan. 

What if you could...
