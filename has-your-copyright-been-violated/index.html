<p>One of the certainties of the Internet is that if you write long enough, some idiot will eventually try to steal your material.</p>

<p>Remember grade school, where the world was divided into people who did their homework so they&#39;d be able to pass the test, and those who tried to copy the answers?  Well sure enough, the world is still divided that way.</p>

<p>This morning when I logged into my <a href="http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events">Sacramento Real Estate Blog</a> I found an incoming link to one of my posts, and the title of the link was a jumbled title based on the original title of the post.  Sure enough, when I went over to check out the post, everything except the title had been copied verbatim from the original post.  Not only had this moron copied my post -- they copied what I consider to have been one of the worst posts I&#39;ve written in several weeks.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Google has a relatively <a href="http://www.google.com/blogger_dmca.html">easy way to respond to copyright violations</a> on that you find on Blogger blogs (typically with a URL like ImAnIdiotCopyingYourWork.blogspot.com).  I&#39;ve read other bloggers complain that the process takes some time because you have to submit the request by mail or fax, but I just submitted a complaint following the instructions there, and it took no more than about twenty minutes.</p>
