Frequently Asked Questions
===

Q. Do you have a resume?<br />
A. [Yes, of course](/resume/).

Q. Do you have a resume in Word format?<br/>
A. I don't generally work with third party recruiters.  The point of having my resume on the web site is to have something to show to entrepreneurs or Software Development Managers who might want to hire me as a contractor.  If you're one of the rare third party recruiters who manage to make it past my knucklehead radar, I'll send you one.

Q. Are you on LinkedIn?
A. Yes, [right here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sacramentosoftware).  Contact requests always welcome.
