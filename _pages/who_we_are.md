Who We Are
===
<img alt="Jenniffer and John Lockwood" src="/images/JohnAndJenniffer.jpg" class="nosotros" />

We're Jenniffer and John Lockwood, a husband and wife team who live in Orangevale, CA.

John began programming on a machine with not one, but two floppy drives, and has been a professional software developer most of his adult life. He's currently working full time as a software developer at Eyefinity.  In his off hours, he writes yet more code, helps Jenniffer build her skills, and works to get CodeSolid off the ground.

Jenniffer, although a relative newcomer to the software industry, has begun to build an [impressive resume](/JennifferLockwoodResume/) (in progress).  She is available immediately for software testing or test automation engagements, either on a contract basis or W2.

Recent Projects

In her internship here at CodeSolid, Jenniffer has already published some [IEEE Test Plan Templates](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/test_plan_template) on Github.  She used the template as the basis for the [Goalboost test plan](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/GoalboostTesting), and has already started filling out the test plan quite nicely.  She has also ramped up on Selenium very quickly, so our next steps will be to have her start scripting some of the plan in Selenium.
