Who We Are
===
<img alt="Jenniffer and John Lockwood" src="/images/JohnAndJenniffer.jpg" class="nosotros" />

We're Jenniffer and John Lockwood, a husband and wife team who live in Orangevale, CA.

John began programming on a machine with not one, but two floppy drives, and has been a professional software developer most of his adult life.  While holding down a day job as a software developer, in his off hours he's working on moving [Goalboost.com](http://www.goalboost.com) past the alpha stage, helping Jenniffer to build her skills, and publishing tutorials and code here.

Jenniffer, although a relative newcomer to the software industry, has begun to build an [impressive resume](/JennifferLockwoodResume/) (in progress).  She is available immediately for software testing or test automation engagements, either on a contract basis or W2.

Recent Projects
===

In her internship here at CodeSolid, Jenniffer has already published some [IEEE Test Plan Templates](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/test_plan_template) on Github.  She used the template as the basis for the [Goalboost test plan](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/GoalboostTesting), and has already started filling out the test plan quite nicely.  She has also ramped up on Selenium very quickly, and has begun fleshing out the test plan with some real automation work.
