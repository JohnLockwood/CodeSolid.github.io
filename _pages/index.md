# CodeSolid

CodeSolid is a boutique development shop that provides test automation outsourcing in Java and Ruby on Rails.

We pair a senior developer who can provide project jumpstart and architectural guidance with a junior engineer who can move your project forward while saving your company a ton of money.  A typical pair combines over 20 years of experience between the two developers.

We use Git, Selenium, and Jenkins to provide whatever test automation you need, running on Amazon EC2 instances.

Best of all, we're fully employee owned and utterly focused on the success of your project.  We don't take on more work than we can do, and we don't hard sell, ever.
