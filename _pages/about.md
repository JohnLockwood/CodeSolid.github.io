# About CodeSolid

Hi, I'm John Lockwood, a software engineer with a lot of different interests.  CodeSolid really isn't a company any more, though to the extent that it is, it used to be ParticleWave.

These days CodeSolid is just my personal blog, where I share some of the mayhem that has occurred to me in my interesting journey through many different programming languages.

These days I'm enjoying digging into statistics with my lovely wife Jenniffer, who is embarking on a career as a data scientist.  So pay no attention to all that Java stuff -- there'll be some IPython and Pandas examples here before you know it.
