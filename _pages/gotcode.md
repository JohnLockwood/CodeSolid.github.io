Jenniffer and I have been having a great time with her internship on Goalboost, and we're making decent progress given our other work.  Jenniffer has published some [IEEE Test Plan Templates](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/test_plan_template) on Github.  We're using the markdown template for our [Goalboost test plan](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood/GoalboostTesting), and as this project evolves it will consist of the test plan and associated Selenium test suite for Goalboost.
