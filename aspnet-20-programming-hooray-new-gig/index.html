<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m grateful to my good friends at Robert Half for the exciting gig we&#39;re working on now, developing in ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005.  I&#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.</p>

<p>Actually, after real estate, I wouldn&#39;t mind a LOT of job security, which is why I&#39;m seriously considering just doing .NET alone for the foreseeable future.  Java&#39;s cool enough, but I don&#39;t think it would hurt my current prospects to maybe do some certifications -- and it would certainly help my current client if I threw myself into some spare time .NET hacking in preparation for those certifications, even if in the end I decide the certifications themselves are a superfluous expense.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t be surprised if a lot of what you read here in the months ahead ends up being about the Road to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/webapps/">.NET 2.0 Certification</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
