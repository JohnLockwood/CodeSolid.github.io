          <h2>.NET Contract in Sacramento Going Well</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Jun 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The ASP.NET contract I&#39;m doing in Sac is going quite well so far.  It&#39;s a small and really congenial team, and in less than a week I started to make some good progress on some of the code.</p>

<p>There are some minor hiccups -- development anti-patterns, if you will -- but it doesn&#39;t look like anything too dire.  Some of this involves existing code written by a now-missing contractor,  which is always a delicate matter.  Everyone likes the guy and he&#39;s clearly very sharp in his work, but some of the underlying framework of his that we&#39;re coding too may have a bit of architectural gold plating (which is not so bad in itself except in insofar as it may violate the Pragmatic &quot;DRY&quot; rule).  A little more of a concern is that it may drive our efforts in the wrong direction as far as being fat / difficult to fix (which IS so bad in itself).  Must learn more...</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just code, which can always be fixed or tossed.  The really tough job -- good management and a team that gets along well -- is already in place.  Without that no amount of code will save you anyway.</p>

<p>Also, being in Visual Studio again is a treat.  It&#39;s always had a fairly competent debugger -- and let&#39;s face it, as a programmer, that&#39;s home.  I keep a SlickEdit window open for the heavy editorial lifting, of course.  The new SourceSafe integration is flawless so far, too, and that&#39;s quite nice.  I&#39;m starting to get a pretty good feel for ASP.NET.</p>
