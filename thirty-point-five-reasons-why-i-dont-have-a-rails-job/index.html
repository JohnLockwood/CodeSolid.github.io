            <h1>Thirty Point Five Reasons Why I Don't have a Rails Job.</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">03 Nov 2012</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>There are at least twenty reasons I don&#39;t have a Rails job. Actually there are 30.5 -- hindsight really is quite precise, isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m on my laptop keyboard, and I generally prefer something full sized without this silly track pad in the middle that ends up making my cursor jump around when I&#39;m trying to publish something stupid.</p>

<p>Normally in an article like this you&#39;d write an ordered list, but since I&#39;m on a cheesy keyboard I&#39;m going to make a virtue of necessity and quip that ordered lists are just a form of Powerpoint, and I&#39;m going to write my reasons inline, like this:  (1) being too lazy, when on his laptop keyboard, to type a proper ordered list.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working pretty hard on Rails in my off hours, on and off for some four or five years now.  Sometimes I&#39;ll work on an open source project for a little while, thinking that maybe (2) my lack of &quot;giving back to the Rails community&quot; is the reason I don&#39;t have a Rails job.  (I don&#39;t know if Rails is a ghetto or not, but it is a strange bunch of people who judge professional success by how much working for free one can put up with).  </p>

<p>In case you missed it, the last paragraph had reason (3), I cite the Rails is a Ghetto article, without even linking to it, which is pretty much a variation on reason 1. </p>

<p>OK, so back to working hard.  When I&#39;m not trying to demonstrate my professionalism by being an amateur, I&#39;m often working a project that&#39;s supposed to make me money someday, thinking it&#39;s my lack of a Sass app in the channel.  (That was 3.5, and sorry for the fraction, but I found it while proofreading).  Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.relaysafe.com">my latest unfinished Rails project</a>, which at present boasts (4) a mere 132 specs.</p>

<p>That brings me to reason (5), dropping buzzwords like &quot;specs&quot; when recruiters think I should know something about unit testing instead, which brings me to my next points (6) relying on insider jokes to get me hired and (7) being implicitly disrespectful of recruiters.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m not working on either some open source project or a risky scheme, I&#39;m spinning out of control learning new gems.  Wheeee!!!   I always yell Wheeee!!! when I&#39;m spinning out of control learning new gems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so liberating (8) having a blog that nobody reads.  It really is.</p>

<p>OK, so part of the thing is (9) I live in Sacramento (or close enough, but who the hell has heard of Orangevale?).</p>

<p>Some upshots of this are that (10) there&#39;s a perception that whether Rails is a (technical) Ghetto or not, Sacramento certainly is.  Also, the only Rails shop in the local area is [redacted], and (11) those dummies didn&#39;t hire me after (12) I made a mistake on a programming problem which (13) only had about twenty or so specs in it.  And now I&#39;ve gone and publicly called someone who didn&#39;t hire me dummies, demonstrating one or more of the following:  (14) I&#39;m not a good salesman or (15) my feelings are too easily hurt and (16) I&#39;m just a bitter and depressed weirdo, not a young and vibrant Mac owner.  But hey, I redacted them.  Serves them right.  And that&#39;s the last time I&#39;m dacting them, too.</p>

<p>There, I said it, you cheeky wonkers, (15) I don&#39;t own a Mac.  I (16) program Rails on a Linux Mint box, which (17) some people don&#39;t know is based on Ubuntu.  I even (18) use an IDE, which is why I have only 132 specs in my little unfinished project instead of the million and seventy-two it would need if I didn&#39;t use an IDE.  That is to say, I use an IDE when I&#39;m not using gvim, which of course is (19) not Textmate.  What&#39;s worse, my IDE was written by the good folks at IntelliJ using Java, a language (20) which has semi-colons in it.</p>

<p>Semi-colons!  Oh the humanity!</p>

<p>And speaking of humanity, did I just call my readers &quot;cheeky wonkers&quot;?  Damn.  (21).</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s (22) my resume, which has lots of .NET and C# and Java and C++ and C and PHP and Perl and ASP and so forth on it, when you (23) recruiter types are looking for a &quot;senior rails developer with 4-5 years experience&quot;, meaning that either I have (24) too much experience or (25) too little, depending on how you want to reject me.</p>

<p>Now, living in Sacramento (op cit.), people may also have the (26) mistaken idea that I won&#39;t relocate if you throw a bunch of money at me, and that I&#39;m just a cheeky wonker looking for a telecommute position, which granted would be nice, but not necessary.  Also, I can&#39;t really show up at the local Rails user&#39;s group, because 83.4% of the people there come from Streamsend, and I&#39;ve already gone on record above as a bitter and lonely coot who (27) burns his bridges.</p>

<p>This is getting out of hand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably (28) too opinionated even for Rails.</p>

<p>Gems I&#39;ve learned and used in the last week include HAML, YARD, and Mongo.  I probably should have mentioned them earlier.  Maybe I&#39;m (29) not opinionated enough.</p>

<p>One or more of us has no sense of humor.</p>

<p>Oh, sorry:  (30).</p>
