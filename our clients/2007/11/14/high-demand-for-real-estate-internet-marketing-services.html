<div class="post">
<p>The last few days I&#39;ve been getting a steady flow of traffic to the site.  There haven&#39;t been as many subscribers as I&#39;d like to have yet, but in general I&#39;ve been hearing from a lot of people and getting a few nice &quot;keep up the good work emails.&quot;</p>

<p>Even more encouraging, especially as I&#39;m starting to talk about possible service offerings like my is the number of calls I&#39;ve been getting from people who already have a real estate blog that they&#39;ve purchased from another vendor and who&#39;ve been picking my brain for solutions to problems the other vendor doesn&#39;t provide.</p>

<p>A few things have become obvious in the course of these discussions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People are paying more than they should for separate web sites and blogging solutions.  Given that I run several sites that successfully integrate IDX and Wordpress blogs, and given that I&#39;m an IHomefinder reseller, I can compete on cost and still provide an excellent product.</p></li>
<li><p>People are also paying a huge amount just to learn how to blog.  Now granted, if you&#39;re non-technical, there are some skills that need to be mastered, but I believe you can do a lot of this online with some combination of 1) the right tutorials and 2) online teleconferencing courses.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The other thing that&#39;s also helping me sharpen up my service offerings has been thinking through some of the parts of my outline of a <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/08/outline-of-a-course-on-becoming-a-real-estate-webmaster/">Real Estate Webmaster Training Course</a>.  As I was doing this, it became pretty apparent that I was probably getting into far too much depth on certain issues in my zeal to create a sort of &quot;Help-U-Sell (Online)&quot; discount model.</p>

<p>I probably had this &quot;Every-Agent-A-Webmaster&quot; zeal as an overreaction to that nagging question that I keep thinking about:  You paid <strong>HOW MUCH</strong> *<em>AGAIN *</em>to learn how to use Wordpress ? ! ?</p>

<p>Probably there&#39;s a way to cook this porridge so that it&#39;s neither too hot nor to cold.</p>

<p>PS:  It turns out I _have _had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge">porridge</a>.  It&#39;s just oatmeal.  Who knew?</p>
