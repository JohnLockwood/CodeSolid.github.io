<p class="meta">06 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>On a business level, I&#39;m so passionate about Internet marketing because it works so well.  But underneath it all, what really drives me is that I get such a boyish geek kick out of watching new web sites start to take off and start to be able to make their owners money.</p>

<p>So naturally it gives me great pleasure to see how successful Pete Thompson&#39;s <a href="http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/">Illinois Mortgage Rates and News</a> is in after only a short time.  We&#39;ve been having a phone conference every other day or so to get his new blog established, and it&#39;s really fun to see the creativity and humor he brings to bear.  For example, in a recent post, Pete <a href="http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/2007/12/05/despite-what-youve-heard-mortgage-companies-are-still-in-the-business-of-lending-money/">dispelled the myth</a> that mortgage brokers have packed it in and no one&#39;s getting loans any more.  (This point is less obvious than it appears.  Listening to some of my clients, I&#39;m beginning to think that tales of people not qualifying for loans have taken on the status of urban legends!)</p>

<p>Pete&#39;s already had a few people stop by and comment, and he&#39;s indexed by some of the more important blog search engines and social networking services, and Google&#39;s started picking up his content as well.</p>

<p>What really gets me excited as well is that he&#39;s well on his way (we&#39;ll do a few more tweaks over the next few days), and he was able to accomplish this for about 1/6th the cost of one of my competitors.  So in the first year, he&#39;ll save some $2,800** **for the same results, and he&#39;ll continue to save year after year on his web hosting bill.</p>
