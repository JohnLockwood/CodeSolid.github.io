            <h2>Testing Devise Authentication in Rails 3.1</h2>
<p class="meta">06 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I ran into a bit of a hiccup while writing tests in RSpec for a site I&#39;m working on which is using Devise for authentication.  I spent a short time working through the documentation at <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Controllers-and-Views-tests-with-Rails-3-(and-rspec">testing Devise using rspec and controller tests</a>), only to end up stubbing my toe on the following caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Authenticated routes in Rails 3
If you choose to authenticate in routes.rb, you lose the ability to test your routes via assert<em>routing (which combines assert</em>recognizes and assert_generates, so you lose them also). It’s a limitation in Rails: Rack runs first and checks your routing information but since functional/controller tests run at the controller level, you cannot provide authentication information to Rack which means request.env[‘warden’] is nil and Devise generates one of the following errors:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NoMethodError: undefined method &#39;authenticate!&#39; for nil:NilClass
  NoMethodError: undefined method &#39;authenticate?&#39; for nil:NilClass
The solution is to test your routes via integration tests. Authenticating your routes has its advantages, this is one of the disadvantages.</p>

<p>This was just the error I was getting when running my controller tests, so it looked like I needed to go after them in in integration tests.</p>

<p>Fortunately with a bit of Google-Fu, it turned out this is not an unusual problem. I was lucky to run into Andy Lindeman&#39;s excellent post on <a href="http://alindeman.github.com/2011/09/25/testing-devise-with-rspec-request-specs-and-capybara.html">Testing Devise with RSpec and Capybara</a>. </p>

<p>First I had to install CapyBara, which I hadn&#39;t worked with before (See Lindeman&#39;s article for details on how to install this).  I based my solution on Lindeman&#39;s code, but with a couple of variations.  First, I wanted to wrap his code in a module so I could call it from any test.  Also, I modified his code to ensure that if the user was not registered, we&#39;d register him, and if he was registered, we&#39;d log him in.  This helped me make the code he provided easier to use and more re-entrant.</p>

<p>To accomplish this in RSpec, I added the following line to spec_helper.rb in the spec directory:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]
    config.extend RequestMacros, :type =&gt; :request
[/cc]</p>

<p>That done, I added the module code to a new file, spec/support/request_macros.rb.  As you can see in the snippet below, it looks for the user in the database, and if not found, registers the user (which logs the user in as a side effect).  If the user is found, it logs the user in.  (I&#39;ve coded the email and password here along the way, but this could be DRY&#39;ed up a bit by getting the user information from FactoryGirl).</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]
module RequestMacros 
  def login<em>site</em>admin
   before(:each) do
      # Ensure registered
      email = &quot;someone@test.com&quot;
      password = &quot;password&quot;
      user = User.find<em>by</em>email(email)
      if user.nil?
        visit &quot;/users/sign<em>up&quot;
        fill</em>in &quot;Email&quot;,                 :with =&gt; email 
        fill<em>in &quot;Password&quot;,              :with =&gt; password
        fill</em>in &quot;Password confirmation&quot;, :with =&gt; password
        click<em>button &quot;Sign up&quot;
        page.should have</em>content(&quot;successfully&quot;)
      else
        visit &quot;/users/sign<em>in&quot;
        fill</em>in &quot;Email&quot;,                 :with =&gt; email 
        fill<em>in &quot;Password&quot;,              :with =&gt; password
        click</em>button &quot;Sign in&quot;
      end
   end
  end
end
[/cc]</p>

<p>Finally, because in integration testing we&#39;re not really testing Rails objects but are dealing with input and output as the web browser sees it, I had to set up a test page to verify that things were working as planned.  I&#39;ll no doubt yank this page later as I develop &quot;real tests&quot; for the functionality I want, and develop the functionality along with the tests.  In the meantime, the target test page (views/people/test.html.erb) is simplicity itself:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;rails&quot;]
&lt;%= 
if user<em>signed</em>in? 
  &quot;true&quot;
else
  &quot;false&quot;
end
%&gt;</p>

<p>[/cc]</p>

<p>With this done and the route for the test in place (we don&#39;t need a controller method because the default rendering will pick up the view), we&#39;re now ready for the test itself, in spec/requests/people_spec.rb. (Assuming you want to test the &quot;PeopleController&quot;, if not, modify this and the view location to suit). You&#39;ll see we test that we can log in a second time as well:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]
require &#39;spec_helper&#39;</p>

<p>describe &quot;People&quot;, :type =&gt; :request do</p>

<p>login<em>site</em>admin </p>

<p>it &quot;signs<em>me</em>in&quot; do
   visit &quot;/people/test&quot;
   page.should have_content(&quot;true&quot;)
  end</p>

<p>it &quot;signs<em>me</em>in<em>again&quot; do
   visit &quot;/people/test&quot;
   page.should have</em>content(&quot;true&quot;)
  end
end
[/cc]</p>

<p>Run the spec as below to verify that it works!</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;bash&quot;]
rake spec SPEC=spec/requests/people_spec.rb
[/cc]</p>

<p>Hopefully that will save you a few minutes of time.  Enjoy!</p>
