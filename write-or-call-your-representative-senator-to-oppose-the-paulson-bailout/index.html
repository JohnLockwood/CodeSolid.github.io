            <h1>Write or Call Your Representative / Senator to Oppose the Paulson Bailout</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">22 Sep 2008</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>I don&#39;t know how much you&#39;re following the news of the bailout of wall street banks who repackaged bad loans, but if you&#39;re not, now is a great time to get involved and please, please call your elected representative and tell everyone you can about this incredible fiasco.</p>

<p>Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and George Bush are asking Congress for the authority to spend up to <strong>$700 billion</strong> at a time (that&#39;s a balance sheet maximum, not a maximum on the total the government can spend). That&#39;s more than the <a href="http://zfacts.com/p/447.html">total cost of the War in Iraq</a> so far. The Treasury will spend it buying bad loans, and get no equity stake in the firms they&#39;re buying them from -- leading some to call it &quot;cash for trash&quot;.</p>

<p>Section eight of the proposed legislation gives Paulson an oversight-free blank check as to how to spend that much of your money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?ref=business">full text here</a>.</p>

<p>Although as you might expect, public opposition to the plan is strongest among Democrats, several prominent conservatives have also <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html">gone on record</a> as being opposed to the plan. This legislation is so bad that <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html">even CNN gets it</a>. </p>

<p>Please look up and either write to or phone your <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senator</a> and <a href="http://www.house.gov/house/MemStateSearch.shtml">House Representative</a> right away. You can learn more about the proposal by clicking through on the articles current on Digg for <a href="http://digg.com/business_finance">Business and Finance</a>.</p>

<p>Congress is in a HUGE RUSH to get this done, so those of us who think it&#39;s expensive, ill conceived and leaves us stuck holding the bill need to MOVE NOW to express our concerns to Congress.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  </p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html">latest draft the bill</a>, which I must admit I think is substantially better than Paulson&#39;s original proposal. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say this makes me for the bill, but at least it&#39;s moving in the right direction.</p>
