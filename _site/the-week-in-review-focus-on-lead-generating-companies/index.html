          <h2>The Week In Review - Focus on Lead Generating Companies</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Recently I announced a new guest author series entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/">What&#39;s Your Internet Real Estate Marketing Strategy?</a>&quot; The point of that series is to hear from Realtors® who are successful in their online marketing efforts but who have a view of Internet marketing that&#39;s different from mine.</p>

<p>One of the ways it&#39;s possible to be successful online that&#39;s about as different as it can be from the way I do it is to use online lead reseller companies like HomeGain.com. On Monday I&#39;ll have an article that talks about how my own Internet marketing evolution is a response against a &quot;lead reseller&quot; agent in my office, and how I swung to the other extreme to become highly focused on Search Engine Optimization and content development.</p>

<p>With this in mind, this week I started looking into information about these companies and looking for Realtors® with an opinion on them one way or another. Minnesota&#39;s Josyln Panka sparked an excellent discussion, the comments of which serve as a sort of introduction to <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/92968/HomeGain-anyone-familiar">Realtor® opinions about HomeGain</a>. One commenter there, Nevada Broker, <a href="http://suenelsonteam.com">Sue Nelson</a>, had some very positive things to say about her HomeGain results, so I stopped by and invited her to talk about her marketing strategy in our forthcoming series. Another person weighing in on this thread was Louis Cammarosano, HomeGain&#39;s general manager. Googling his name will bring you to all sorts of other interesting links about HomeGain versus Zillow.</p>

<p>Former HomeGain Sales Director Chris Hendricks defended HomeGain&#39;s switch to a monthly-subscription model for its AgentEvaulator product by discussing an absolutely crucial element to successful online marketing -- <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/61401/Different-Vantages-Yield-Vastly">successful follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best single source for discussion of HomeGain and other lead generation companies that I found was on Realtown.com&#39;s <a href="http://www.realtown.com/LeadGeneration/blog/">Lead Generation Blog</a>. An excellent guide to who the players are is the &quot;View by Vendor&quot; blogroll on the left hand side, and the articles here are a good mix of criticisms of the Lead Generation companies and success stories.</p>
