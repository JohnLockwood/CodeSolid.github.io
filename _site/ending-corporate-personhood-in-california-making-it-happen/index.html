          <h2>Ending Corporate Personhood in California - Making it Happen</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Dec 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The overwhelming challenge of ending corporate personhood is this:Â  How do we get people who are bought and paid for by corporations to bite the hand that feeds them?</p>

<p>My answer -- and I&#39;m looking forward to meeting with you to have a discussion about other ideas -- is to show them that if they don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds them, the hands that pull the voting levers will pick someone else.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, it seems to me this boils down to having at least one fairly committed activist in each State Assembly district, State Senate district, and U.S. Congressional district who is willing to work toward the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finding out by phone, mail, or best yet, by personal meeting whether their state or federal representatives will support one of the many proposals in the House of Representatives to eliminate corporate personhood. (for example, the proposals of <a href="http://jimmcgovern.com/corporatepersonhood/">Jim McGovern</a>, <a href="http://teddeutch.house.gov/UploadedFiles/DEUTCH_036_xml.pdf">Ted Deutch</a>, or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6cehXA5mHo&amp;feature=player_embedded">Donna Edwards</a> (Co-sponsored by John Conyers and others).</p></li>
<li><p>If they will support it, finding out what we can do to help them.</p></li>
<li><p>Circulating petitions locally.</p></li>
<li><p>If they won&#39;t support it, get them to go on record, preferably with press cameras around, saying that they believe corporations are people, or refusing to say it and refusing to support a constitutional amendment AND / OR convince them that we will endorse their campaign and provide them with all the support we can if they will support it AND / OR having a press-covered meeting with them in which you present them with a petition with a substantial number of signatures of voters in their district (and then having them go on record one way or the other) AND /OR probing to find out what might make them change their mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Following up to ensure that they do what they said they would and provide them with whatever help you offered, or publishing the fact that they didn&#39;t.</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinating with the press and local political organizations such as the Occupy Movement or the Tea Party who can help us.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In a short time I&#39;ll also start posting some meetup times -- probably we&#39;ll do these by WebEx or a similar online service.</p>

<p>I hope to meet you and have a chance to talk to you very soon.</p>
