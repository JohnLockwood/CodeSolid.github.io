          <h2>Microsoft ASP.NET MVC: A Glimmer of Hope for Ruby Programmers (or is that ASP.NET Programmers?)</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Sep 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p><a href="http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/15/late-born-head-case-ponders-microsoft-certification/">Late born head case</a> that I am, I vibrate between programming languages like a sort of high tech lady’s toy.</p>

<p>Analyze that.</p>

<p>Thus it is that I wrote an article recently comparing <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/04/19/aspnet-versus-ruby-on-rails/">ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails</a>.  In that article I mentioned Microsoft’s pathetic support for the Model View Controller pattern.  This was based on work I’d done an eon ago in programming time, 2006 or 2007 or so.  With that I was able to declare:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may have changed since I last looked at it, but on my last ASP.NET contract they had an MVC implementation that completely broke browser navigation and was a nightmare to code to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I don’t have all the details yet, but I’m happy to report that since that glib dismissal Microsoft has had Ruby in its sights in a big way, and has further refined something they were no doubt working on when I made that dated statement.  (You know what print journalists bag on us bloggers for – we’re light on our fact checking).  Enter <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">Microsoft MVC</a> complete with a 15 minute podcast by Stephen Walther.  Look familiar?  It should.  Of course this is straight out of the Ruby on Rails 15 minute podcast, which in turn was lifted whole cloth from the pioneering work of <a href="http://www.coboloncogs.org">Cobol on Cogs</a>.</p>

<p>Cobol on Cogs was obviously a parody of Ruby on Rails, and I’m sure there are Ruby programmers who probably consider ASP.NET MVC to be in the same category, though interestingly enough, the official rails blog mentions Cobol on Cogs but not ASP.NET MVC.  Much of what you can find there are bashes of ASP.NET (like <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/7/5/not-knowing-where-it-hurts-in-asp-net">this</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/8/25/dont-look-at-rails-if-you-have-to-do-net">this</a>) that were absolutely legitimate in 2005 but might be getting a bit obsolete by 2010.</p>

<p>I’m going to take a look at ASP.NET MVC, and in case I end up hating it, let me be the first to call it this:   Cobol on Cogs 2.0.</p>

<p>Meantime I certainly wouldn’t count out Microsoft’s ability to steal someone else’s ideas, market them, and provide me with a job in the process.  C Sharp, after all, is “Java run through a thesaurus”, and Redmond has the law suits to prove it.  I suspect we’re in the next phase of this, and I find it exciting.</p>

<p>So I’m going to spend another hour or two on the <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">coolest programming web site ever</a>, which incidentally is written in ASP.NET MVC.</p>
