<!-- <p class="meta">21 Nov 2012</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>Over the last few days I revisited the code for my project, <a href="http://www.relaysafe.com">RelaySafe Secure Email</a>, after taking some detours into:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learning MongoDB and working on the beginnings of a different site and...</p></li>
<li><p>Starting a Ruby on Rails User Group in Folsom, and within a week...</p></li>
<li><p>Wondering if I&#39;ll have the perseverance to continue with the Ruby on Rails User Group in Folsom and...</p></li>
<li><p>Registering for a CollabFinder account and fielding &quot;job offers&quot; from folks who apparently don&#39;t understand that the word &quot;job&quot; implies some sort of remuneration, and...</p></li>
<li><p>Going off in another direction, in Spanish.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Along the way I also read an article by a developer who worked on an open source project I worked on.  The article was about being a developer and <a href="http://tashian.com/carl/startup.html">foundering in a start-up</a>, and it sounded all too familiar to me.  I too know what it&#39;s like to have one idea, work on it for awhile, hit a roadblock of some kind, and then instead of finding away around or through, ending up on a different road entirely.</p>

<p>This is what happens when developers are in charge.</p>

<p><strong>Salesmen are Your Friends</strong></p>

<p>I was in sales for awhile.  I&#39;m not sure I was ever really good at it, but it did give me a better understanding of  how sales people look at the world.</p>

<p>When I was in sales I wrote some web sites to help me, which from a software perspective were complete hacks, yet which were successful from a sales perspective.</p>

<p>Sales is a different world.  As Dan Akroyd&#39;s character, Ray, said famously in Ghostbusters, &quot;I&#39;ve worked in the private sector.  They expect results.&quot;</p>

<p>As a developer, I look at my silly pre-alpha app and wonder, &quot;I wonder if this other thing over there would be more fun to work on?&quot;</p>

<p>As a salesman, I know that &quot;this thing over there&quot; that might be more fun to work on is both less finished and more difficult than my original app.</p>

<p>Salesman are those guys in your company who are always asking &quot;when will it be ready?&quot;, as though the development work were easy, and as though you really could predict the finish date with absolute accuracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to let me inner salesman run the company for a few weeks.  It won&#39;t be much fun listening to that bozo, but the app will move forward, and it may become something I can sell.</p>
