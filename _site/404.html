      <b><a href="/we-are-moving">We are moving</a></b><br />1 June 2014<br />
      For some time now my ParticleWave site has been fairly schizophrenic, being also JohnLockwood.com and Codesolid.com.

To add to the lack of mental health around this site, I&#39;ve been meaning to move the whole site to Jekyll for some time,
because I&#39;m tired of wordpress updates and stupid spam comments.  In other words, I&#39;m moving from Wordpress to Jekyll for the same reason 
everybody moves from Wordpress to Jekyll.

As of this post, my site is live on Github pages, as you can see if you&#39;re reading it.

There was a LOT involved in making the move, and I took lousy notes.  So this is not a tutorial, or not much of one -- sorry.  It&#39;s more of an announcement for the one or two people who are kind enough to read me from time to time.   Getting Wordpress to Jekyll was one nasty little bit of business which I have forgotten since I did it weeks ago.  I do recall that it started with Google and involved typing, so I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re smart you can reproduce it.  More recently I&#39;m able to credit David Ensinger&#39;s <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/">fine article</a> on how to workaround the fact that your plugins are likely not supported by Github.  Nice job there and helpful,
and my own stripped down version of his Rakefile is in the <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/tree/source">source for this site</a>.  My version
works around some issues I had (I found I had to force the pushes to master for some reason), and it removes some of the sass-specific stuff he had added 
since I&#39;m not using sass at the moment.

Most importantly, it&#39;s nice to have a starter site here I can begin to build out.  You&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a lot to be done, the pages are just stubs, etc., etc.  There&#39;s no domain actually pointing here yet, though we&#39;ll work on having it be CodeSolid.com before too long.

And now finally I have a place for the blog posts to go, so I can keep writing.  For about two months I&#39;ve written very little on ParticleWave since I know it&#39;s going away.

Now I can feed my keyboard addition again.

      Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.

One of my conservative friends who I haven&#39;t seen in a few years used to say that his quarrel with liberals was that they had a lot of knee-jerk ideas. A search for &quot;knee jerk liberal&quot; returns 431,000 Google results, while &quot;knee jerk conservative&quot; returns only 408,000, which proves (scientifically, of course) that liberals have 5.6% more knees than conservatives.

I firmly believe that in any given environment, you’re going to end up spending most of your programming career manipulating strings one way or another. Because of this, learning .NET’s regular expression support -- unlike many of the other topics you’re likely to encounter on the certification exam, is not one of those Use It and Lose It things.

      In .NET, delegates are classes that implement type safe function pointers.  Like all function pointers, they can be used whereever you need dynamic execution of code.  One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&#39;re raised.

      The memory for reference types is allocated on the system heap, so it makes sense that reference variables can be null. Value types, in contrast, cannot be assigned a &quot;null” value by default. Still, there are times when you may want to declare a int (for example) and allow it to be set null – one obvious use is in reading and writing data from a database. Enter the Nullable type. Here’s a brief sample that shows how these types work.

      Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it&#39;s installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn&#39;t Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0—Application Development Foundation</a>, which I was planning to take anyway.  Pretty cool.

      I&#39;m grateful to my good friends at Robert Half for the exciting gig we&#39;re working on now, developing in ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005.  I&#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.

      I&#39;ve been digging a little more into Ruby, and I definitely get what the excitement is about.  As a few authors have said, Ruby strikes one as <a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/xml_matters_18.html">Perl done right</a>.   I loved PERL, even when it was done wrong, so needless to say I&#39;m really having a blast in Ruby.

      Well, it&#39;s time to order a nice speedy computer so we can load it up with the sort of slow software that people will pay you to work on.  Interestingly enough, functional open source works great for the self-employed, but to work in the software you have to have at least a grudging aquaintance with some bloated commercial apps.

      After every major Google update, it seems, someone will come out with a new obituary, announcing the death of reciprocal linking.  And it&#39;s true that in recent years, Google seems to have downplayed reciprocal linking in their algorithm.  Yet for all of that, reciprocal linking is alive and well.

      We&#39;re starting to explore the video and audio to get our sellers&#39; homes sold and the message out about our team.   Two trends have come together to make this a good time to get into this.  First, most homes that have Internet now have high speed connections, cable modems or DSL.  Secondly, DVD players have come down in price and are now nearly ubiquitous, and media is becoming more inexpensive, allowing us to use the same message in multiple ways.
