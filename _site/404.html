      Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.

      Here is the first of what should really be several .NET Regular Expressions examples. I firmly believe that in any given environment, you’re going to end up spending most of your programming career manipulating strings one way or another. Because of this, learning .NET’s regular expression support -- unlike many of the other topics you’re likely to encounter on the certification exam, is not one of those Use It and Lose It things. It’s something that’s really useful.

      In .NET, delegates are classes that implement type safe function pointers.  Like all function pointers, they can be used whereever you need dynamic execution of code.  One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&#39;re raised.

      The memory for reference types is allocated on the system heap, so it makes sense that reference variables can be null. Value types, in contrast, cannot be assigned a &quot;null” value by default. Still, there are times when you may want to declare a int (for example) and allow it to be set null – one obvious use is in reading and writing data from a database. Enter the Nullable type. Here’s a brief sample that shows how these types work.

How about a steady stream of people who start commenting on your posts almost as soon as they hit your site?  Do you want more page views because more page views means more advertising revenue, or are you content with capturing a smaller, focused niche in the search engines to help you sell your product or service?  Do you want to convert more of your visitors to closed sales, or are you simply trying to reach a larger audience with your message?

      I&#39;ve made my living for many years as a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) specialist with myself and the people who work for me as my sole &quot;client&quot;.  Now with Inklit.com I have an opportunity to explore the broader world of Internet writing.  Like most people, new things interest me only if I can relate them to what I already know.  Because of this, I&#39;m fascinated by how Internet writing in general relates to SEO writing.

There are days when writing is simplicity itself, when ideas and connections seem to grow in natural abundance, when we feel the only limitation of human eloquence is our typing speed. Then there are days when we must write through the dense stickiness of our own stupidity.

      Have you been successful in your real estate or lending career largely (or partially) because of your Internet marketing?   Our &quot;What&#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&quot; series (see our <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/">announcement</a>) highlights authors who are using the Internet to close more business.  You don&#39;t have to have an &quot;Internet-only&quot; marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we&#39;ll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we&#39;re looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.

Get 2/3 of a night&#39;s sleep on Friday night, and wake up before the sun to write some Transact SQL for the realcrm project I&#39;m working on, and along the way go install and start using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91">Subversion for Windows</a>.

      Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it&#39;s installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn&#39;t Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0—Application Development Foundation</a>, which I was planning to take anyway.

I&#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.
