  <b><a href="/early-asp-net-mvc-troubleshooting">Early ASP.NET MVC Troubleshooting</a></b><br />6 September 2009<br />
  After happily switching between Visual 2005 and Visual Studio 2010 beta for several days, I installed Visual Studio 2008 recently so I could get started on ASP.NET MVC. Well Hello World worked more or less without a hitch, but inside that “more or less” are two stumbling blocks I hit which I mention here in case anyone else stubs their toes in the same place:

  <b><a href="/delegates-and-events">Delegates and Events</a></b><br />28 August 2009<br />
  In .NET, delegates are classes that implement type safe function pointers.  Like all function pointers, they can be used whereever you need dynamic execution of code.  One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&#39;re raised.

  <b><a href="/nullable-types-example">Nullable Types Example</a></b><br />20 August 2009<br />
  The memory for reference types is allocated on the system heap, so it makes sense that reference variables can be null. Value types, in contrast, cannot be assigned a &quot;null” value by default. Still, there are times when you may want to declare a int (for example) and allow it to be set null – one obvious use is in reading and writing data from a database. Enter the Nullable type. Here’s a brief sample that shows how these types work.

  <b><a href="/dell-studio-17-review">Dell Studio 17 Review</a></b><br />17 August 2009<br />
  I’m told that somewhere around the dawn of software development, when processor time was hugely expensive and multiple university departments shared a single computing resource, it was common to have to work out your software problems using a sharpened pencil or similar Flintstones-level tool before your code ever felt the warm embrace of powered silicon.

  <b><a href="/development-driven-development">Development Driven Development</a></b><br />23 July 2009<br />
  Some time ago I waxed ecstatic over JUnit automated unit tests here, and I think the software community has gotten even more wild-eyed over automated tests in the meantime, with the latest buzz about Behavior Driven Development.  For my part, lately I&#39;ve begun to question all this conventional wisdom.  I&#39;ve begun to believe that the fact that programmers love testing so much for the same reason Twitter is so popular:  writing short little works is more fun than reading something long and difficult.

  In my last post I discussed some of the pros and cons of Ruby on Rails versus .NET.  One of my complaints at the time was that Ruby lacks a good graphical unit test runner, because I&#39;m a sucker for a green bar.  I also complained that running tests is cumbersome on Windows.

  My friend and college housemate <a href="http://dimsumthinking.com/blog/">Daniel Steinberg</a> stopped by  recently and caught me red-handed in yet another heinous act of last week&#39;s marketing.  By &quot;last week&#39;s marketing&quot;, I mean that I should know better than to say this site is about a specific platform / language/ technology.  This is generally the wrong approach for a computer-linguistic gadabout to take.  John Lockwood putting up a web site about a programming language is like Madonna putting up a web site about her one true love.  The next words out of her mouth are bound to be:  &quot;Woops, no I mean my other one true love.&quot;
