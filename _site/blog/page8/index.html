  If you were lured to this post by the title, you shouldn&#39;t feel bad.  I didn&#39;t really write this title to trick you, though I did write it to make a point.  I&#39;m actually going to show you how to do it by the end of the article, too, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to accuse me of trickery.

  <b><a href="/tips-for-setting-writing-goals-a-stack-of-twenty">Tips for Setting Writing Goals — A Stack of Twenty</a></b><br />24 March 2008<br />
  How are we to write well, and consistently? There are days when writing is simplicity itself, when ideas and connections seem to grow in natural abundance, when we feel the only limitation of human eloquence is our typing speed. Then there are days when we must write through the dense stickiness of our own stupidity.

  <b><a href="/resources-for-making-money-by-writing-online">Resources for Making Money by Writing Online</a></b><br />9 March 2008<br />
  I am starting an article series that will be dedicated to pointing out the online resources that I find most helpful when it comes to the topic of this blog, which is working as a writer online. Because it&#39;s an article series instead of just a collection of links, it will be a little different than a traditional Resources Directory or Blogroll.
