  So far in our Twenty-One Days to a Better Blog Series (<a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/11/twenty-one-days-to-a-better-blog/">Intro</a>, <a href="http://www.inklit.com/series/21DaysTableOfContent.php">Table of Contents</a>), we&#39;ve been talking about elements of your blog that you usually work on when your blog is still young, such as what platform it will be running on.  We also talked about how your domain name, title, tagline, and theme will work together to let your reader know right away that your blog is one that they&#39;ll want to read.

  A few years back I read a story about successful podcasters and one of the podcasts that got a great review was Grammar Girl&#39;s Quick and Dirty Grammar Tips. To tell the truth I&#39;d forgotten all about this site until recently, when I happened to stumble upon it using, as you may have already guessed, StumbleUpon.

  If you were lured to this post by the title, you shouldn&#39;t feel bad.  I didn&#39;t really write this title to trick you, though I did write it to make a point.  I&#39;m actually going to show you how to do it by the end of the article, too, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to accuse me of trickery.

  How are we to write well, and consistently? There are days when writing is simplicity itself, when ideas and connections seem to grow in natural abundance, when we feel the only limitation of human eloquence is our typing speed. Then there are days when we must write through the dense stickiness of our own stupidity.

  I am starting an article series that will be dedicated to pointing out the online resources that I find most helpful when it comes to the topic of this blog, which is working as a writer online. Because it&#39;s an article series instead of just a collection of links, it will be a little different than a traditional Resources Directory or Blogroll.

  One of the (many) great things about the Wordpress blogging platform is the huge number of enthusiastic supporters who write third party plugins.  Very often, if Wordpress doesn&#39;t seem to do what you want yet, you can find a Plugin that will modify its behavior so that it will.
