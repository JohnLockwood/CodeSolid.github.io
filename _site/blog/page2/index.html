  There are at least twenty reasons I don&#39;t have a Rails job. Actually there are 30.5 -- hindsight really is quite precise, isn&#39;t it?

  I am working on a Rails project that I have &quot;in production&quot; (barely), albeit in a state that&#39;s not even pre-beta enough to announce.

  <b><a href="/troubleshooting-passenger-and-devise-problems-on-ruby-on-rails">Troubleshooting Passenger and Devise Problems on Ruby on Rails</a></b><br />11 July 2012<br />
  I spent more time than I&#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.

  I ran into a bit of a hiccup while writing tests in RSpec for a site I&#39;m working on which is using Devise for authentication.  I spent a short time working through the documentation at <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Controllers-and-Views-tests-with-Rails-3-(and-rspec)">testing Devise using rspec and controller tests</a>, only to end up stubbing my toe on the following caveat:

  I work in a Microsoft shop during the day working mostly on legacy code written in C, C++, C#, and some VB.NET. There was an incident at work recently that turned me into a Rails Contractor, through some interesting alchemy involving pointy hair, which I will describe below.

  I buy too much crap.  The chances are pretty good that you do, too.  Actually, the chances are even better that you&#39;re a spambot, but let&#39;s leave to one side the issue of my low readership for now.  If you&#39;re here as a human denizen of the interwebs, you probably buy about as much crap as I do.

  The first few times I encountered Python was in a local bookstore, and I think the same book was there each time.  Each time I was immediately put off by this unfortunate volume, which seemed to suggest that the greatest thing about Python was the whitespace, and gave me the impression that whitespace was more significant than it was.

  <b><a href="/back-into-rails">Back into Rails</a></b><br />7 January 2012<br />
  I haven&#39;t wanted to really dig into a software language in a long time, but I&#39;ve been brushing up my Ruby and Rails skills and enjoying it thoroughly. It&#39;s still fun even if I only get to do it in my spare time. I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of making money at it yet, and currently I make a living digging up dinosaur bones in what we will charitably call C++ since that&#39;s what the file extensions seem to denote.

  For someone who considers himself skeptical and rational, I&#39;m a huge fan of self help books.  Naturally, given my skeptical and rational bent, my taste in such books leans heavily toward those that either really are somewhat scientific or at least make a pretense of being that way.

  I&#39;ve been preparing for a tutorial series that I will write soon that will start with a blank screen in a text editor and finish with a complete modern CSS3 web site layout.  I might also include a bilingual Wordpress and / or Drupal theme, depending on how ambitious I&#39;m feeling once I&#39;m well into it.  In preparation, I&#39;ve been perusing several websites to think about what sorts of things I would like to include. I&#39;ll post a follow-up to this article outlining the work we&#39;ll be doing in the tutorial, but meantime, I thought I&#39;d share some of the resources I found, which are excellent.

  <b><a href="/the-unimaginable">The Unimaginable</a></b><br />29 May 2010<br />
  Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.
