            <h1>First Impressions of Cassandra</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">20 Sep 2014</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>Recently I attended a Sacramento Java User&#39;s Group meeting for the first time in many years, and saw an excellent presentation by Jega Aravandy on some work he&#39;s doing with Casandra, Solr, Spring, and Angular.js.  It was exciting work in its own right, and Jega came equipped with plenty of swag that Russell from Datastax (who&#39;d given a talk there earlier that I missed), had asked him to bring along.  So between my wife and I we walked away with newfound insights along with three USBs with Cassandra VMs on them, two coffee mugs and a tee shirt.</p>

<p>Not a bad night&#39;s haul.</p>

<p>A colleague from work and I were there, so we&#39;ve been chatting about Cassandra since.  We&#39;ve been discussing whether we should spend some of the money the company is encouraging us to spend on training on Datastax&#39;s <a href="http://www.datastax.com/what-we-offer/products-services/training/apache-cassandra-core-concepts-skills-and-tools">Introductory Course in Cassandra</a>.  My ethical dilemma is that I can spend the company&#39;s money on this cool bauble I want to learn, but I really think the chances of getting to use this cool bauble at this company are not good, even though they might well still pay for it.</p>

<h1>Reaching a Temporary Compromise:  Hello World</h1>

<p>Struck down by fear at the edge of this dense ethical forest, I retreated to the safety of a trusted old friend -- Hello World.  So I told my work-friend that I&#39;d write my other friend (Hello World) using Cassandra over the weekend, and last night just like that I did it.</p>

<p>Come on people, it&#39;s Hello World.  It&#39;s not meant to be hard.  The only place Hello World was ever hard was Websphere, and that&#39;s only because Websphere is a disaster.</p>

<p>A bit circular, perhaps, but QED.</p>

<p>But enough about Websphere.  Cassandra isn&#39;t a disaster, so Hello World was easy.  As it should be.</p>

<h1>How Easy Was It?</h1>

<p>I have VMWare Player installed here on my personal laptop, so I tried inserting one of the USBs with the Cassandra VM on it and double clicking on the Cassandra-2.0.6.ova file.  VMWare complained a bit, but gave me a message along the lines of &quot;Should I stop complaining and load this?&quot;, so I chose yes.</p>

<p>Being instructed to stop complaining, VMWare dutifully launched the VM, which was good enough to tell me I should try to get to the CSQL console at http://some_local_address:some_port.  </p>

<p>So I typed that URL into Chrome, and, hey presto, without installing Cassandra I was in a cqlsh terminal writing Hello World in it.  This basically involved a process of Googling things like &quot;Cassandra create table&quot;, finding out I needed a keyspace first, and working my way forward through &quot;Cassandra insert&quot; and &quot;Cassandra select&quot;.  Nothing was hard, and if you wanted to make it even easier you could <a href="http://planetcassandra.org/install-cassandra-ova-on-vmware/">read this overview</a>.  My cassandra-newbie fingers made a mistake or two along the way to full hello-worldly glory, but nothing we csql and I couldn&#39;t work through together amicably.</p>

<h1>My Datastax-Sponsored Friends</h1>

<p>There is a pitched battle going on among NoSQL vendors for developer mind-share.  When I took another look at MongoDB recently, the download process required registration first.  I sometimes enter my correct details in those just to see how much hard sell I&#39;ll get before the salesman and I get tired of one another.  </p>

<p>Because I come to Cassandra via a clever Datastax swag USB stick, I didn&#39;t have to fill out a form, and no salesman has called me.  I did however get a lot of cool new Datastax-sponsored friends on Twitter when I mentioned that I had mastered the non-challenge of hello world.  </p>

<p>Full disclosure:  one of them offered me more Datastax swag if I share my experiences in getting started.  So I&#39;m going to point them to this article.  If they&#39;re still my friends after this poor ouvre, then they&#39;ll be the best industry-sponsored pals I ever made.</p>
