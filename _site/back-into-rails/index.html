<p class="meta">07 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I haven&#39;t wanted to really dig into a software language in a long time, but I&#39;ve been brushing up my Ruby and Rails skills and enjoying it thoroughly. It&#39;s still fun even if I only get to do it in my spare time. I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of making money at it yet, and currently I make a living digging up dinosaur bones in what we will charitably call C++ since that&#39;s what the file extensions seem to denote.</p>

<p>Dinosaur bones. Well, what the hell, I&#39;m an old guy. We tend to do that.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the Rails frenzy about? Well it&#39;s certainly not about working, at least in the short term. There isn&#39;t a Rails job within 50 miles of here. Sacramento is the land that time forgot, like that Twilight Zone episode where the guy gets off the train and it&#39;s the 1920&#39;s.</p>

<p>The real genesis of the thing started when I wanted to put a web site together that would support and allow open Direct Democracy. The idea is that we&#39;d take Congressional voting records and develop a sort of report card as to the extent to which our representatives did -- or didn&#39;t -- represent us. Of course, the foregone conclusion is that they don&#39;t, but in the process of finding that out, we might arrive at a more perfect union.</p>

<p>Stranger things have happened.</p>

<p>I started out trying to tackle this beast in PHP, and dug into CakePHP as a way of avoiding the two problems I always had to avoid when working on Rails:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hosting sucks.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to work on Rails in Windows is like trying to speak Chinese in Venezuela. Sure, you can do it, but if your goal is Chinese, you&#39;re really better off in China. Which in the case of Rails means a Linux box or a Mac.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem was that solving this problem via CakePHP is like solving having car trouble by buying a toy car. CakePHP runs brilliantly on Apache Windows and I&#39;m sure hosting would be a breeze, but compared to Rails it turns out to be somewhat limiting, both in the maturity of the platform and the size of the community of developers and contributors.</p>

<p>So as we speak, a copy of Paragon Hard Disk Manager 11 is running in the background, backing up a big old Windows partition before moving a bunch of stuff around and installing dual boot Linux, which it will also help me do. Then this laptop will become a laptop again, and my wife can use the desktop Linux machine that&#39;s just sitting in the living room gathering dust as a real desktop machine. The total cost of this solution is well over a thousand bucks less than the Macbook Air I&#39;m drooling over, but until we find Jenniffer a job here in the US (she&#39;s a Drafter with lots of Autodesk if you know anyone), I&#39;m in &quot;let&#39;s do it on the cheap&quot; mode.</p>

<p>So in the last few weeks I&#39;ve been re-exploring the Rails world, and finding all sorts of goodies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. OK, GitHub has been there for several years, but I only recently set up an account, first for my CakePHP stuff and later for the Rails work. I paid a few bucks to be able to keep private repositories, but I&#39;m also possibly going to do some Open Source work.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-i/">RSpec</a>.  OK, yes, Cucumber too but to my untrained eyes so far I must say Cucumber looks wordy enough to step outside the boundaries of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain&#x27;t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>, whereas RSpec still seems pretty clean.  Tomayto, Tomahto.</p></li>
<li><p>Russ Olsen&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325954089&amp;sr=8-1">Eloquent Ruby</a>.  This is one of those books that does a great job of putting the language into some sort of context, and does so in a way both teaches you more about the language and lets you make sense of it at the same time.  This one&#39;s worth a look.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>.  Want to have feature rich web site registration and authentication pretty much ready to rock and roll in about half an hour?  There you go.  By way of comparison, I spent maybe half a day on some stock CakePHP code to do the same thing, and it wasn&#39;t even close to as done.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/rbjarnason/open-active-democracy">Open Democracy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opengovernment/govkit">GovKit</a>, some open source projects making rolling an open democracy web site less of a development effort (oh well, so much for teaching myself things) and more of an integration effort (hey presto, learn by doing).  And hey look, the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> -- I&#39;m digging stuff up even as we speak.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So there you go.  Learn Ruby.  It&#39;s the patriotic thing to do.</p>
