            <h2>Troubleshooting Passenger and Devise Problems on Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I spent more time than I&#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.</p>

<p>At first all I saw were 404 errors.  Thinking it was a Passenger issue, my first stop was to try finding out about Passenger logging.  This led me to set up my apache configuration file for this virtual host as follows:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;XML&quot;]</p>

<p>ServerName myservername.com
  PassengerLogLevel 3                             &lt;-- Add this line!
  DocumentRoot /var/www/apps/prjectdirectory/public</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Options -Multiviews
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny 
    Allow from all
</code></pre></div>
<p>[/cc]</p>

<p>Since this was an early deployment effort, I also temporarily moved config/environments/development.rb to config/environments/production.rb, thus picking up some of the development time debug settings.</p>

<p>By the time I&#39;d done this, the page was at least starting to point me in the right direction, by displaying the error:</p>

<p>[cc]
No route matches {:controller=&gt;“devise/home”}.
[/cc]</p>

<p>Well, that was a little more helpful than a 404 message, but not much.  The error output from passenger in the Apache log wasn&#39;t much help either.  Google-Fu, StackOverflow -- nothing helpful.</p>

<p>Meantime, one thing that kept nagging at me was the fact that I was also seeing the problem if I ran the app under WebBrick using production settings (i.e.:  &quot;RAILS_ENV=production rails s&quot;).  </p>

<p><strong>Looking in the Wrong Place</strong></p>

<p>Often I find that a few minutes before a daunting software puzzler turns into trivial child&#39;s play, I stop looking for the solution in the &quot;wrong&quot; (according to hindsight) place.  In this case, the fact that this was also failing in WebBrick led me to conclude that what I should be troubleshooting in this case was not passenger -- but the Rails app itself.  Never mind that it worked in development -- it wasn&#39;t working here, in not one but two web servers.  </p>

<p>At this point I turned on Rails logging.  (Yay -- good answer -- and the crowd went wild!)</p>

<p>Adding the following line to production.rb was all I needed:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]
config.log_level = :debug
[/cc]</p>

<p>Doing that, restarting the server and navigating to mysite.com/users/sign_up, the log (in the default location of &quot;log/production.log&quot; showed me this call stack:</p>

<p>[cc]
Started GET &quot;/users/sign<em>up&quot; for 207.183.247.194 at 2012-07-10 23:56:21 +0000
Processing by Devise::RegistrationsController#new as HTML
  Rendered devise/</em>links.erb (0.5ms)
  Rendered devise/registrations/new.html.erb within layouts/application (4.4ms)
  Rendered layouts/<em>dev</em>nav.html.erb (0.8ms)
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 18ms
[/cc]</p>

<p>At this point the log helpfully was pointing me to just the page where the error was happening.  Looking at the partial in &quot;views/layouts/<em>dev</em>nav.html.erb&quot;, the advice of the articles I&#39;d found about the problem along the way now made sense:  this was a scoping problem in a link_to call.  Actually there were a few such calls, but the solution was the same in each case:  Add a &quot;/&quot; to the beginning of the controller &quot;name&quot;.  In other words, change this:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]</p>

<p>&lt;%= link_to &quot;Home&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;home&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; %&gt;</p>

<p>[/cc]</p>

<p>To this:</p>

<p>[cc lang=&quot;ruby&quot;]</p>

<p>&lt;%= link_to &quot;Home&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;/home&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; %&gt;</p>

<p>[/cc]</p>

<p>This makes sure that &quot;home&quot; isn&#39;t considered to be a Devise controller, even in the context of rendering a Devise view.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, the best way to debug Passenger and Devise problems on Rails is not to treat them as Passenger or Devise problems.   Underneath whatever&#39;s broken is a Rails application, and that Rails application has excellent logging available.</p>
