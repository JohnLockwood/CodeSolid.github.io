            <h1>How to Get In the Zone (A Reminder to myself in Case I Someday Read Me)</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">15 Sep 2012</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>What matters to me most about software is that it lets me get in the zone, or a state of flow.</p>

<p>Yes, software is how I make a living, but making a living at software, I very often report to a boss or other stakeholder whose pointy hair prevents me from getting into a state of flow, so by two in the afternoon I&#39;m tired and forcing myself to just plod along at the now inimical keyboard.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when I&#39;m in a state of flow on a project, I could go for hours, except for occasional lonely moments like this when I feel I need to explain something to somebody.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be great to have a job where I could spend more time in the zone, which I find myself getting into quite often on my current Rails side-project.</p>

<p>I could tell you the zone is about RSpec and Intellj with the Rails plugin and simplecov on a particular machine with Linux Mint installed and the right keyboard -- but of course, those are just temporary implementation details. I&#39;ve been in the zone on the same keyboard under Windows 7 and Visual Studio and NUnit.</p>

<p>What it&#39;s really about is being alone with a good unit test suite on a good keyboard, making progress on a project.</p>

<p>Ambition kills it, plodding along strengthens it.</p>

<p>The whole elephant sometimes kills it, unless you can quickly grab the tail or the trunk or the leg to work on.</p>

<p>Numbers help. How many specs did I do? What does the coverage report say?</p>

<p>Knowing that at some point enough specs and enough coverage with a little bit of code each day will turn into a product helps.</p>

<p>It may not be a great product, and it may not sell, but spending too much time on that sort of thinking is a surefire route out of the zone and onto working on someone else&#39;s idea of a product, which is just a downward spiral. Someone else&#39;s product is fine if you&#39;re doing it when your fresh at 11:00 AM on a Tuesday and collecting a paycheck for it. But if you&#39;re going to burn weekend after weekend away from your bicycle, doing it on someone else&#39;s Rube Goldberg device, well, all that ever gets you is tired and frustrated.</p>

<p>So here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stay in the present.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t take a job without counting the unit tests first, unless they let you write it from scratch (in which case, count the money first) :).</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the tail, or the trunk, or the leg.  Your zone poem for the day:  &quot;The elephant is irrelevant&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re not getting paid for it, it&#39;s your code, period.  If you need a friend, go to the pound and pet a puppy.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back to work, or go outside and ride your bicycle.  Explaining things should be done in moderation.  Ain&#39;t nobody reading you anyway.  See the line with the puppy.</p></li>
</ul>
