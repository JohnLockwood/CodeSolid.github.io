          <h2>Using Ant and XDoclet with JDO</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jun 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>One of the simple joys in programming is trying out new little hacks designed to prove a concept or try out something previously unfamiliar.</p>

<p>When I last used Java, Ant was a fairly new thing, and for some reason I had a lot of resistance to learning it.  Now, Ant and Maven are fairly ubiquitous.   Also, I&#39;ve been wanting to take on some work in XDoclet, since it seems like almost everywhere you look -- whether in EJB or in &quot;lightweight&quot; POJO tools like hibernate or JDO, there&#39;s still some heavyweight XML configuration or metadata that needs to either get generated or maintained.   (No wonder Java 1.5 adds support for attributes -- and no wonder again that Ruby on Rails finds &quot;favoring convention over configuration&quot; to be a perfectly legitimate marketing strategy).</p>

<p>Anyhow, I do have some working code hacked together for using Ant and XDoclet and JDO -- here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/hacks/AntXdocletJDOHacks.zip">Zip File</a>.  src.com.particlewave.apps contains the java code, and build.xml is of course the Ant script.  To run it, you&#39;ll need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">ant</a> and <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">junit</a> and you&#39;ll need to have a lib directory with the unzipped jars from the <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/install.html">XDoclet libraries</a> available to ant on it&#39;s classpath.  For my first hack I was just working on getting XDoclet working to create JDO configuration files.  Some good help in that direction came from JPox&#39;s excellent <a href="http://www.jpox.org/docs/1_1/xdoclet.html">XDoclet JDO example</a>.  Another sample I discovered later is <a href="http://www.solarmetric.com/Software/Documentation/3.4.0/docs/ref_guide_integration_xdoclet.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The jpox sample helped me debug a nasty and obscure problem with my own code.  It turns out that -- for jdo at least, I haven&#39;t tried xdoclet in general on this -- you need to have your comments in the form:</p>

<p><code>
/**
   *  Double asterisks on first comment line.
   *
*/
</code></p>

<p>not</p>

<p><code>
/*
   * See the single asterisk on first comment line.
   *
*/
</code></p>

<p>Using a single asterisk will create a JDO file, but even if your @jdo.whatever tags are all correct, the file will be empty.  This was a bit cumbersome to track down, so I point it out in case someone else puts their leg in the same bear trap.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
