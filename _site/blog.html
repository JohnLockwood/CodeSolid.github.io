      <p>Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.</p>

      <p>Lately the well publicized quitting of Facebook by many Google empoyees and others over privacy issues has struck me as rather funny. OK, exactly what state secrets do you have on Facebook that would be a huge problem if someone found out? You like the movie Avatar? You play basketball? Yep, I could get your bank account information easily with that data. Your name? Make one up if you&#39;re paranoid. Your birthday? Likewise.</p>

One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&#39;re raised.</p>

How about a steady stream of people who start commenting on your posts almost as soon as they hit your site?  Do you want more page views because more page views means more advertising revenue, or are you content with capturing a smaller, focused niche in the search engines to help you sell your product or service?  Do you want to convert more of your visitors to closed sales, or are you simply trying to reach a larger audience with your message?</p>

      <p>Those of you who know me from my real estate brokerage may also know Purva Brown, who contributes to my real estate blog.  Purva also hosts a fine real estate blog of her own, <a href="http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com">The Sacramento Real Estate Gal</a>.  Purva joined my real estate company last year.  She originally thought she was taking on a mentor when it comes to search engine optimization and Internet marketing, but as it turned out, Purva&#39;s helped me to expand my writing horizons at least as much as I ever helped her.</p>

After a few articles, I was hooked and added her to my feed reader right away.

Jennifer&#39;s blog is one of the few blogs that I&#39;ve not only subscribed but have also started &quot;reading backwards&quot;.  Her post about <a href="http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/plr-legitimate-business-model-or.html">PLR writing</a> inspired a later post of mine, and her <a href="http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-post-should-be-simple-and-easy-if.html">writing scams</a> article was also a treat.

You don&#39;t have to have an &quot;Internet-only&quot; marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we&#39;ll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we&#39;re looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.</p>

      <p>I recently set as a goal for myself to learn all I can about depression and motivation.  This is because I found that as I actively began to examine my life and create goals for each area (i.e., take control of my destiny), I found this process very enjoyable and anti-depressing in nature.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m almost certainly going to change the behavior of the aggregator soon so if you&#39;re wondering where your links and summaries went, that&#39;s where.  I have the cron job that automated the aggregator turned off in the meantime.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve put up new blog rolls both here and on my Sacramento blog.  Going forward I would like to add a great deal more sites -- not only real estate sites, but also favorite local sites.  So please add a comment if you have sites you&#39;d like listed yourself or know of a site for the East Bay region that I should be linking to.</p>

      <p>Well, ParticleWave is more or less up and running, and we just need to flesh it out with some articles about Real Estate Blogs and the like, and spread the word to other bloggers that this resource is here.  Special thanks to Charles Johnson, whose outstanding <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">Feedwordpress</a> Plugin turned this three week task into something  more like five hours.  Thanks as well to Ed Rosenthal who had the courage to be the first person besides me to offer up his feed to be syndicated here.</p>

Because this directory is rising phoenix-like from the ashes of a fairly well-promoted site of ours, our old software development web site, ParticleWave.</p>
