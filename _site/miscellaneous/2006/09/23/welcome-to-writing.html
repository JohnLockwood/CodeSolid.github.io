          <h2>Welcome to Writing</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Sep 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Today I add a new category: writing.   Hello, new category.  It&#39;s so easy to smile at such a friendly and welcome new visitor.</p>

<p>This first post in this friendly new category is also a bit of homework for a new book, &quot;The Freelance Writer&#39;s Bible&quot;.  The point of the exercise was to go write something, as an illustration of how simple it is to get over writer&#39;s block.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure I have writer&#39;s block, per se.  I write all the time.  What I do wish to remove, however, are my remaining getting-paid-for-it blocks.</p>

<p>One might say that insofar as my real estate business is based on my successful web sites, and inasmuch as my web sites are successful because I write, that I&#39;m also already a professional writer.</p>

<p>What a joy, then, this weekend, to discover that there&#39;s actually a business to be made of the activity of writing.</p>

<p>In my high school yearbook, I wrote down that my dream was to have one wife, one son, one dog, and one published novel.  As it turns out, I am fortunate to have a lovely wife, a wonderful daughter, two four-legged dogs, and no published novels.   Even to this day, having a novel seems a bit out there, something uncomprehended, a vague possiblity.   But it&#39;s less of a stretch for my impoverished imagination to get from a place where I blindly chase for search engine love with a mixed bag of sites both successful and fairly well free, to a place where I work on a business of writing for pay.  This journey strikes me as altogether entertaining and worthy of my time.</p>

<p>So best of luck to you, new category.  I sense the spark of greatness in you already, your potential to become the fulfillment of the goal I set recently, for this web site to be about something.</p>
