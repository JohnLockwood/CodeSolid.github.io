          <h2>Buddhism Without Beliefs</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Here&#39;s a book I want to look into soon.  I&#39;ve seen it around for some time, waiting for me to read it.  The other night a member of my meditation group mentioned this book to someone who was a Buddhist but not ready to accept certain ideas on faith, like rebirth.  He might just as well have been talking to me, since I&#39;m not ready either.  Actually I sense a little bit of a difference, inasmuch as I find I don&#39;t care too much.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some great material in the Pali Canon that has a bearing on this issue, and is quoted in chapter 3 of Bhikku Bodhi&#39;s &quot;In The Buddha&#39;s Words&quot; -- which is a book which waited a very short time indeed for me to read it.  This is a wonderful book, that makes me want to stuff the whole Pali Canon into my head.  Where&#39;s my shoe horn?</p>

<p>I believe one can see Bikkhu Bodhi is wrestling with some of Batchelor&#39;s concerns in some of his own prefaces to the Pali Canon material.  But you don&#39;t have to buy the book to see him grapple with it head on, since you can check out <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha106.htm">Bodhi&#39;s review of Batchelor&#39;s book</a>.   Since my last philosophical destination prior to Buddhism was atheism, I am very sympathetic to what I know about Batchelor&#39;s position while at the same time being fairly untroubled about the whole issue.</p>

<p>I think some times those of us who are agnostic or atheistic in our beliefs fight a primarily social battle, in which we long to be accepted by our fellows, who may have some elements of a lifestyle we wish to pursue, but who have no compunctions about faithful leaps they&#39;re supposed to be making in their tradition.  I&#39;m sympathetic to Batchelor, but I think at the same time I&#39;d already fought this fight so well in another context that I don&#39;t see much need for it in Buddhism.  It helps to be a newcomer in some respects.</p>
