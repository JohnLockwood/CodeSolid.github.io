<div class="post">
<p>I have a goal for this web site.  It&#39;s an important goal, but I&#39;m very much in the beginning phases of implementing it.  The goal for this web site is to be about something.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not too much to ask, is it?</p>

<p>It used to be this site was about software, and it was a good place to try out new web development techniques.  So I&#39;d rewrite it endlessly.  In the same way, neolithic web developers would use the same wall on the same cave in France, and whenever they wanted to paint a new buffalo they&#39;d just paint over the old buffalo.  That&#39;s why if you actually start clicking around here you&#39;ll find the remnants of past mental civilizations, old articles on Assembly Language, even.</p>

<p>Buffalos.</p>

<p>Today the site might be described charitably as an eclectic brew of intellectual musings, or uncharitably as drive by victim of its author&#39;s mid life crisis.  But I don&#39;t want to leave it at that.  I want this site to be about something.</p>

<p>For one thing, I hate to give up this site&#39;s modest but established traffic.  There are links here, and page rank.  It&#39;s the postunmodern equivalent of having one paleolithic dummy saying to one another, &quot;Hey Og, I know where there&#39;s a bunch of pictures of buffaloes.  Want to see it?&quot;</p>

<p>And as we all know, Og famously replied:  &quot;What&#39;s a picture?&quot;</p>

<p>But what if the artist, Og Monet as it were, gets tired of painting buffaloes?  Then you&#39;ve got this neatly trampled dirt leading to the buffalo gallery, and some dispirited former artist scribbling to-do lists where the deer and the antelope played.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m waiting for this site to be about something, I&#39;ll link to some more Buddhist pals, and maybe it&#39;ll end up being about that.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s more earnestly about something, you&#39;ll be the first to know.</p>
