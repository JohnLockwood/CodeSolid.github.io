          <h2>Selecting Real Estate Keywords</h2>
<p class="meta">01 May 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For many types of web site promotion campaigns, it&#39;s very important to pick the right keywords to target.  This is true whether your web site deals with real estate or not, so let&#39;s take the general case first.  Any web site owner wants to target keywords that a buyer will be likely to search for, and the more specific the better.   You want to include the keywords that a likely buyer will select, and, believe it or not, you also want to exclude some keyword combinations, too.  If you&#39;re selling shoes and the user is searching for &quot;brake shoes&quot;, for example, chances are that that&#39;s not a click you want to pay for.  The matching options of both Yahoo Sponsored Search (formerly Overture) and Google Adwords let you specify such combinations to exclude.</p>

<p>In the specific case of real estate web sites, finding the right keywords to target is  straightforward.  We recommend making two lists.  The first is a list of geographical areas near you.  For Oakland, for example, one might choose Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Hayward, Fremont and the like.    The second list always starts with &quot;real estate&quot; and then gets into synonyms and special types of real estate.  So this list might include &quot;real estate, homes, land, luxury homes, condos, duplexes, townhomes, town homes, starter homes, investment properties&quot; etc. etc.  You might also include in the second list such terms as &quot;first time buyer, home loan, mortgage, relocation&quot; etc.   Your keyword choices then include a word from the first list plus a word from the second, so if each list includes ten items, you end up with 100 keyword combinations.</p>

<p>Alright, that&#39;s fine, but which keywords do you either bid on (pay per click) or optimize your site for (organic search results)?  Choosing which keywords to target is a more time consuming process.  You want to strike a balance between keywords that get lots of clicks, and keywords that are relatively inexpensive or have low competition.  For example, in general, &quot;Bigtown Real Estate&quot; is going to be the most searched keyword, but that means that it also will be the one with the most competition.   On the other hand, &quot;Smalltown condos&quot; may cost much less per click, but may not bring you enough visitors.</p>

<p>High competition keywords mean more work to optimize your site for the keyword if you&#39;re talking about search engine optimization.  If you&#39;re doing pay-per-click, it typically means a higher bid to achieve the same position.</p>

<p>A great free search tool for keyword research is Yahoo&#39;s  <a href="http://inventory.overture.com/d/searchinventory/suggestion/">keyword selection tool</a>.  Take some of the 100 keywords you came up with from your list above, and enter them here.  For each keyword, jot down the resulting numbers, &quot;5232&quot; or &quot;523&quot;, for example.   Overture is sometimes criticized for having misleading numbers, but we really don&#39;t care about absolute numbers so much as relative traffic.    In the contrived example above, for instance, clearly one keyword gets about 10 times as much traffic as the other.</p>

<p>By understanding how much traffic you can expect from a given keyword, you&#39;ll be able to spot whatever &quot;bargains&quot; may be lurking in the existing bids for these keywords.  Keywords priced low are great, but keywords priced low but that offer a moderate amount of traffic are even better.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve gleaned what you can from the Yahoo Keyword tool, you may also want to investigate the <a href="http://www.wordtracker.com">Wordtracker</a> paid keyword database.  Wordtracker offers more tools for doing keyword research, and their database is compiled from several different &quot;metacrawlers&quot; (search engines that compile results from different search engines), so the results have somewhat more broad appeal than the Overture results.</p>

<p>Of course, having the right keywords is only half the battle -- you also want to send your visitors to a page that&#39;s relevant to what they&#39;re searching for.  Landing page creation is a whole different branch of the art.  In the months ahead we may have a product offering that will facilitate this, or at minimum we will have some more articles about this subject.</p>
