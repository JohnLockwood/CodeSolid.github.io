<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;ve put up my first free real estate content article.  It&#39;s here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.particlewave.com/freecontent/Expired101.php">Show Me a Five Dollar Bill, and I&#39;ll Show You Why Your Listing Expired</a>.</p>

<p>My goal is to do one a week, since this is the year I&#39;m trying to get away from those silly looking little link directories, but in the meantime I need to find some way for the search engines to find me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do another post soon about some of the resources I find useful as I dig further into article submission.  One that&#39;s already been somewhat helpful and generated a few ideas is <a href="http://www.submityourarticle.com">SubmitYourArticle.com</a>.  They&#39;re web site is pretty much an opt-in email list, but so far it&#39;s pretty much been just good solid information.  I&#39;m not at the point of recommending their article submission services yet, however.  I&#39;m still looking at many of the folks out there writing, and trying to understand how much their writing helps their search positions, but I&#39;m somewhat wary of the effect of automated services given the web&#39;s history with link submission services and the like.  If anyone&#39;s used SubmitYourArticle.com or another article submission service and wants to be interviewed, let me know.</p>
