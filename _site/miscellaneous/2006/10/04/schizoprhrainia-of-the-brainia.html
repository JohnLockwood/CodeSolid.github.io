<div class="post">
<p>There was a cartoon once in which a character was accused by some mad doctor type of having &quot;Schizophrenia of the Brainia&quot; -- I put up a variant spelling above so you can see how to pronounce it.</p>

<p>Probably it was a Flintstones episode.  I was glued to those as a kid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the spirit of schizophrenia of the brainia that I reflect today on my web site and blog here.  On the one hand I have a personal blog that&#39;s kind of fun, about Buddhism and Depression and what-note that I feel like what-noting.  On the other hand, I really want to use this prime &quot;internet marketing real estate&quot; to talk about (and sell) &quot;internet real estate marketing&quot; as a service.  Pardon the clever use of dyslexia.</p>

<p>But schizophrenia / multiple personality disorder isn&#39;t really the metaphor I&#39;m going for.  The goal of a doctor treating a patient with multiple personality disorder is to get them to become re-integrated.  But the goal of doctor me in treating this multiple personality web site, unless I miss my guess, should be to disintegrate it into two separate blogs.</p>
