          <h2>Lazy Boy Buddhism Revisited</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Oct 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p>It&#39;s almost time to sit.</p>

<p>Tonight is Tuesday, the night of my Sangha meeting, which I skipped this evening.  Last week during the sit I felt a great deal of tension, which I think comes from the wrong seat -- a rather uncomfortable plastic chair.</p>

<p>Say what you will about floor Buddhists:  at least they know what they&#39;re sitting on.</p>

<p>This week there was knowing about that, and darn it, just getting busy feeding some silly video game.  So I get to write about it, which isn&#39;t doing too much for me as you can plainly see, and then I get to sit on my lazy boy, which lately has been quite wonderful.</p>

<p>My meditation sessions since Tuesday have been some of the best ever, very deep, relaxed, insightful -- almost as though I can feel my brain being reprogrammed.  Yes, indeed that is a materialistic way to put it.  One little exercise that I&#39;ve been enjoying is shining the white metta light on whatever disturbances or ill feelings arise.  Tonight however I feel like I should nap before the sit a while -- there&#39;s not much brain left at the end of the wick.</p>
