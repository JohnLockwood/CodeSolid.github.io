<p>Ten days ago I posted <a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/">How To Get 101 Subscribers to your New Blog in 30 Days</a>. This means I&#39;m one third of the way to our April 10th deadline to claim the 101 subscriber bragging rights. So here&#39;s an account of our progress so far.</p>

<p>When I posted the article on the eleventh, I had a grand total of eight subscribers, down from a high of ten a couple of days earlier. Since then, we&#39;ve reached a high of forty-four subscribers as of a couple of days ago, and currently we&#39;re showing forty-two subscribers. So we&#39;ve added 34 subscribers in ten days. Assuming we can do that again twice in the twenty days that remain, we&#39;ll finish up with 110 subscribers, well above the 101 we&#39;re shooting for.</p>

<p><strong>What I&#39;ve Learned, Guest Posts, and The Winner So Far</strong></p>

<p>Getting thirty-four subscribers again during each of the next two ten-day periods will be a challenge.</p>

<p>I believe that of the 34 subscribers we&#39;ve picked up so far, probably about twenty of them come from my <a href="http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html">guest post</a> on the Real Estate Tomato. Another two to four probably come from miscellaneous sources including ActiveRain, and the remaining ten to twelve come from StumbleUpon. So the likely winner to date for the contest would be Jim Cronin at the <a href="http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/">Real Estate Tomato</a>, with the runner up spot going to Bob Younce at the <a href="http://writing-journey.com/">Writing Journey</a> for introducing my site to StumbleUpon.</p>

<p>From a subscriber standpoint, the guest post had the best results, StumbleUpon has done a better job in terms of raw traffic. StumbleUpon has sent me 614 hits to date, versus 120 for Entrecard and sixty-five for the Real Estate Tomato.</p>

<p><strong>Guest Post Progress Stalls</strong></p>

<p>I lost forward momentum on the guest posts after the Tomato article. I submitted an article to Anne Wayman at the Golden Pencil, but got no response after almost a week and another email. Since then I&#39;ve sent a rewrite of that article to <a href="http://www.chrisblogging.com">ChrisBlogging.com</a>. I&#39;ll let you know if it goes anywhere the second time, and how the other submissions go.</p>

<p>Commercial time: Do you have great traffic and want a guest post to win a six month ad? Check out our <a href="http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise/">ad contest</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been making more progress on submitting some articles to low-paying or link-paying article submission sites. The ones I&#39;ve tried so far are Associated Content (which doesn&#39;t impress me, even though they pay) and <a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com">EZineArticles.com</a> (which does impress me, even though they don&#39;t pay). I do expect to get some benefit from EZineArticles over time given the links they let you publish, but I don&#39;t expect to see results before the April 10th deadline.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Results</strong></p>

<p>I still have my work cut out for me to get to 101 in 30 days, but I&#39;m on track so far, and I&#39;m very pleased with how things are going. My unique visitor count is certainly better than I expected it to be at this point (more than 200 per day on average, which I consider excellent for 21 days on a brand new domain). I&#39;ve made some new friends, and it seems like every day I&#39;m learning something new.</p>
