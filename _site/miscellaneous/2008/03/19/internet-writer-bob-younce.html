<div class="post">
<p>If you&#39;re a writer working on the Internet, Bob Younce&#39;s <a href="http://writing-journey.com">Writing Journey</a> is one of the blogs you should be reading.  I&#39;m not saying this because Bob&#39;s blog is an easy read, though don&#39;t get me wrong, his style is fine.  Bob&#39;s blog can be a tough read because it&#39;s loaded with the kind of advice that makes you think &quot;You know, darn it, he&#39;s right -- that is something I should be doing a better job at doing.&quot;  For example, his article <a href="http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/4-keys-to-establishing-your-brand-as-an-internet-writer">4 Keys to Establishing Your Brand as an Internet Writer</a> reminded me of the fact that this blog, Inklit, had yet to settle on what it wants to be when it grows up.  Am I writing for would-be Internet writers, sharing my journey from a one-client-wonder to a writer who&#39;s succeeding online?  Or am I changing the title tag to Internet Writer and going for the gusto as a search engine optimized sales piece?  Or am I just another ProBlogger wannabe <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jamoke">jamoke</a> with an AdSense account, a pink carnation and a pickup truck?</p>

<p>Another really great thing about Bob&#39;s blog is that unlike many blogs, it comes with Bob!    What distinguishes Bob from most of the writers out there is that he doesn&#39;t just write for the Internet -- he actually reads it as well.   Bob was one of the first people to come by, find my blog, and engage me in a conversation, and he makes a good case for establishing such peer relationships in his 4 Keys article.</p>
