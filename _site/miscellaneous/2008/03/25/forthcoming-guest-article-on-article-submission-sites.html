          <h2>Forthcoming Guest Article on Article Submission Sites</h2>
<p class="meta">25 Mar 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The past few years have witnessed an explosion in the number of sites promising Freelancers they can make money writing online. Even in small niches, competition abounds. The number of sites competing to match authors of paid reviews with paying sponsors has risen to three (that I know of -- there may be more). Every day another freelance writing job board pokes through the Internet like a dandelion on an already ruined lawn, with <a href="http://jobs.copyblogger.com/">Copyblogger&#39;s new job board</a> being a famous recent example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, too, can get <a href="http://jobs.copyblogger.com/job/7573618562621f33369005ddebb6e2f2/?d=1">$10 for each 500 word article</a> you submit. Unless you write a lot faster than me, that works out to about $11.67. per hour for contract work. Did you ever start a blog and then say to yourself, why didn&#39;t I pick something profitable, like a blog about working at McDonalds?</p>

<p>With all the interest in transforming online writing from a hobby into a profit center, it&#39;s not surprising that article submission boards have risen in popularity. Bob Younce <a href="http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/a-directory-of-internet-article-writing-sites">recently surveyed</a> five such sites and still had nine left over.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asked to do a guest article comparing two such sites, Associated Content and EZineArticles. It should be out in a day or two. I will let you know.</p>

<p>It may be time for bad<em>attitude</em>guy to go find a mentor or two.</p>
