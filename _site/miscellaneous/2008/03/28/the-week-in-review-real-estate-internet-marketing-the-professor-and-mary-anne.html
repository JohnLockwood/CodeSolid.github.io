<p>This has been a busy week. I was very gratified to get Dave Smith to come by and take part in our new series, <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/03/24/real-estate-blog-labs-dave-smith-on-his-real-estate-internet-marketing-strategy/">What&#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy</a>, and Dave was a big enough draw that subscriptions went up quite a bit after his article. I&#39;ve started making inquiries of some exciting new authors. If you have people you&#39;d like to see, drop me a comment.</p>

<p>Over on Sacramento-Home.com, I had to play fix-the-code-that-Metrolist-broke after our local MLS changed its database structure. I&#39;ve been able to put together quite a few interesting web site features using a combination of MLS exports, a MySQL database, and some PHP programming. The neat thing about such work is that you can offer your users some really custom content and search options, and I&#39;ve found this goes over really well. In spite of all the hype about blogging, home shoppers aren&#39;t looking for a pundit -- they&#39;re looking for a house. The down side is that every year or so you need to spend a day or two fixing code, but for the benefit, it&#39;s certainly worth the time.</p>

<p>Everyone is hanging around on Twitter this week. A few weeks ago everyone was hanging out on FaceBook. As social networks go, you have to like Twitter, because once you&#39;ve set up TwitterFeed to blab at your friends for you, you don&#39;t actually have to spend any time blabbing at them yourself. Well, there I go being a Luddite again. If you want to try your hand at using Twitter to promote your blog, check out <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/">Chris Brogan&#39;s</a> <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/03/25/how-i-use-twitter-to-promote-my-blog/">guest post on ProBlogger</a>. That&#39;s much better. I&#39;ll have to do resource post on Chris over at Inklit -- he&#39;s got some great stuff going on over there.</p>
