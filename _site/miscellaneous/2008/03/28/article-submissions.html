<p>If you&#39;re interested in places where you can submit your articles, check out the guest post I wrote this week, <a href="http://www.vigorouswriting.net/2008/03/freelance-face-off-ezinearticles-versus.html">Freelance Faceoff: EZineArticles Versus Associated Content</a>. Thank you to Jesse Hines at <a href="http://www.vigorouswriting.net">Vigorous Writing</a> for asking me to send that over and for his kind words about the article.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing an article for EZineArtices every few days. I mention in the Vigorous Writing article, it&#39;s working out quite well. Here&#39;s my EZineArticles <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=John_Lockwood">Author Page</a>. Based on one of the mistakes I made, I can offer you the following tip so you can avoid doing the same thing. If you&#39;re going to publish an article somewhere else, be careful if you go back into the EZineArticles editor once your article has been saved and approved. There&#39;s an auto-save feature on the editor. If you&#39;re not careful, you can do what I did, which is accidentally mark an already-approved article as &quot;changed&quot; and thereby send it through the approval process again.</p>

<p>I made that mistake in the context of trying out another article submission site this week: Article City. ArticleCity.com looked really great at first glance, and there were many articles there that had been widely re-circulated. I tried submitting an article there, however, and after a few days it seems pretty likely that nobody&#39;s home. It&#39;s not so unusual that my submission hasn&#39;t received a response yet, but at the same time the site hasn&#39;t changed at all in the past few days. The same article on &quot;Measuring Lubricant Quality&quot; has been on the top of page one during this time, so it doesn&#39;t appear they&#39;ve been approving anyone else&#39;s new articles, either.</p>
