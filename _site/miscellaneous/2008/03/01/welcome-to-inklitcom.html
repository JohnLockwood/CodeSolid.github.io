<p>Inklit is a blog about writing as a career. It has just come into the world like any newborn, slick and helpless and stupid about what it will become. As though struggling for oxygen, it&#39;s the wrong shade of blue.</p>

<p>Inklit was born at 11:00 AM on Saturday, March 1st, 2008.</p>

<p>I had an idea about my writing career, and my idea gave Inklit life. I already have a career as a professional writer of sorts. I am a blogger, pimping used houses to the search engines. This pays the bills, but all by itself it&#39;s not very satisfying. So I thought I would enjoy doing more with my writing career and my life. With this idea, I began to write some stories.</p>

<p>The idea that I would share what I learn about writing as a career gave Inklit life.</p>

<p>Maybe you haven&#39;t made any money writing yet. Or maybe like me you&#39;ve done some writing as a career, and now you want to get better at your writing work, and explore new formats and new markets.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this blog is about. Welcome.</p>
