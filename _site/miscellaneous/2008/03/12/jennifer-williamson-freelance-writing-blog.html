          <h2>Jennifer Williamson — Freelance Writing Blog</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Mar 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Jennifer Williamson is the proprietor of Catalyst Writing Services, and author one of the first blogs about <a href="http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com">freelance writing</a> that I bumped into online.  After a few articles, I was hooked and added her to my feed reader right away.  The first thing that stood out immediately about Jennifer&#39;s blog was the quality of the writing and thinking she put into both her posts and her comments.  Jennifer&#39;s blog is one of the few blogs that I&#39;ve not only subscribed but have also started &quot;reading backwards&quot;.  Her post about <a href="http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/plr-legitimate-business-model-or.html">PLR writing</a> inspired a later post of mine, and her <a href="http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-post-should-be-simple-and-easy-if.html">writing scams</a> article was also a treat.  Jennifer&#39;s blog also has a well maintained and current blog roll that helped me get started on my own resource section and begin learning who my betters are.</p>

<p>And as if that isn&#39;t enough, Jennifer Williamson also has the distinction of being the first person to ever make bold to write a comment here on Inklit, before anyone knew that writing comments here would become a major Internet pastime.</p>
