<p>Happy Friday.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually go for confessional blogs myself, so I usually try not to write like mine is one.  You know the genre.  They usually have a tagline that starts with &quot;Just&quot;, to qualify their author&#39;s efforts.  &quot;Just my thoughts on the war&quot;, for example, or &quot;Just the ramblings of a chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan&quot;.</p>

<p>However, sometimes I live up to my own standards so poorly that I would make a great Republican.  So this is just a happy Friday post, depending on the kindness of strangers, living behind the music store.  It is just a confessional post, with the following confessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I love how easy it is to self publish online, because it means there are lots of opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>I hate how easy it is to self publish online, because it means that every chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan is in competition with me.</p></li>
<li><p>I also hate how easy it is to publish online because I can get confused about which of my projects are important.  Given the terrible, self-imposed imperative to become awesomely popular and the number of chain smoking pregnant teenagers I&#39;m competing with, I feel like I have to come up with a definitive domain / topic / killer app within the next few days or I&#39;ll die penniless, with my young nemeses selling my clothes for cigarette money.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now you know why I hate confessional blogs.</p>

<p>In the interest of replacing this funk with some creative work, I&#39;m going to shift gears now and work on one of those projects.  If you see any teens catching up with me, for God&#39;s sake, won&#39;t you please let them know how bad smoking is for the baby?</p>
