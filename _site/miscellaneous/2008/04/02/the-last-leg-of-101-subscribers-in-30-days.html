<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m into the last 10-day leg of my 101 Subscribers in 30 Days promotion. I&#39;m not as optimistic this time as I was last time, and my numbers have leveled off, at least in the short term. I picked up 34 subscribers in the first ten days, but from that point to today have added only nine more subscribers. As of today we&#39;re at 51 Subscribers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still pretty happy overall with the growth of the blog. After all, it&#39;s brand new, and just celebrated its one month birthday on April Fool&#39;s Day. All in all, an average of 202 visitors per day is good at this point.</p>

<p>By far the biggest contribution to the site&#39;s traffic to date is StumbleUpon, so again, thanks go out to Bob Younce for first submitting me there. Looks like he&#39;s going to win the ad without too much trouble at all <strong>unless some superstar blogger visitor steps up.</strong> Oh sorry, was that in bold?      </p>

<p>This traffic has slowed to a trickle in recent days, partly because I don&#39;t want to overdo stumbling myself.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where most of the referrals are coming from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>http://www.stumbleupon.com 1,615<br>
http://entrecard.com 157<br>
http://www.google.com 90<br>
http://realestatetomato.typepad.com 79<br>
http://www.mybloglog.com 28<br>
http://www.particlewave.com 26<br>
http://blogsearch.google.com 21<br>
http://activerain.com 21<br>
http://articlespecialist.blogspot.com 16<br>
http://www.problogger.net 14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About half of those Google referrals are from subsbcribers using the reader, the other half are from organic search and blog search. Like StumbleUpon, Entrecard has also slowed to a trickle since I&#39;m not over there mindlessly clicking around. The problogger visits are just from a few comments -- pretty amazing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m content to let the numbers grow organically from here on, even though I could probably make a concerted effort to land another tasty guest blogging spot and perhaps pull the numbers in by the skin of my teeth. To be honest, at this stage of the game I&#39;m more interested in focusing in on some topics so I&#39;ll know what I&#39;ll do with those next fifty subscribers when I get them!</p>

<p>To all my current subscribers, thanks so much, and again, I&#39;ll try to keep some worthwhile stuff coming!</p>
