<p class="meta">26 Jan 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>One of the elusive goals that I&#39;ve had for my business for many years is to improve our customer service and our follow-up on leads while centralizing my company&#39;s database of clients.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I was very excited this week when I took a second look at 37signal&#39;s product <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com">HighRise</a>. The first time I looked at HighRise it struck me as a bit simplistic, but this time around it dawned on me that I may have found a solution that does about 99% of what I expect and need it to do, and does it elegantly and affordably.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking IHomeFinder Leads</strong></p>

<p>One of the core features of HighRise is its ability to work superbly well with email. Elite Properties has several real estate <a href="http://www.johnlockwood.com/profile/#WebSites">web sites</a> that I&#39;ve developed over the years, and all the most productive ones are running IHomefinder IDX. For some time now the workflow has looked like: leads come in to my computer, and I either handle them myself or have my email software (Eudora) forward them to the agent on duty. This works tolerably well, but as a broker needless to say I&#39;m always looking out for a way to increase our conversion rate, and I also want to know that the leads my company has spent lots of time developing (through hard earned blogging / SEO sweat equity) are followed up efficiently. Moreover, the system falls down somewhat if an agent is out on a listing appointment or showing property, since when that happens the leads tend to just sit in their inbox all day.</p>

<p>This problem brings us to a core feature of HighRise, the &quot;dropbox&quot;, which is a kind of intelligent mailbox that can read incoming email that&#39;s forwarded to it, figure out who it was forwarded from, and either create a new record for that contact or add the email information to the existing contact. So now instead of forwarding to the agents, which I was already doing, I can simply tell Eudora to forward them to HighRise, and Highrise will instantly create a contact record for the lead, or add it to the contact history that already exists. It doesn&#39;t get every field in the right place (such as phone numbers in the lead), but since the email text is sent along with it, it&#39;s easy to just paste things into the right place.</p>

<p>In addition to email tracking, HighRise allows you to very easily keep notes on conversations and calls, and track tasks you might want to schedule such as follow up calls or emails or property showings. The UI design is mostly elegantly simple and uncluttered, with the tools right where you need them to be.</p>

<p><strong>Tag, You&#39;re It!</strong></p>

<p>HighriseHQ you can &quot;tag&quot; a contact with pretty much any keyword you want, and the tags are pretty much like the blog tags that many of my readers here will be familiar with from &quot;Tag Clouds&quot;. One of the uses I like for Tags is that it allows me to assign a lead to an individual using their name, or to mark it as &quot;Open&quot; so the first agent to be available can claim it. No doubt once you get in to the software you&#39;ll find lots of uses for tags.</p>

<p><strong>The Down Side</strong></p>

<p>HighRise lives and dies by simplicity. The fact that it does a few things extremely well and poses a practically non-existent learning curve is a core feature. On the other hand, once in awhile you find yourself wishing it would do some things better or be a bit more configurable. Although there&#39;s an API available for developers, if you&#39;re a non-programming power user you&#39;ll find that you either like what it does, or you don&#39;t, because you aren&#39;t going to be changing it much. I&#39;m sure a lot of this comes from its developers being a Ruby on Rails shop. Ruby on Rails is a web development tradition noted for an extreme minimalism. This can be great on a tools level, but one might argue that minimalism outlives its usefulness when it seeps into the product.</p>

<p>One feature I would like, for example, relates to upcoming tasks. When you create tasks, they show up in a view that tells you what&#39;s scheduled today, next week, later, etc., and the dates are displayed (without days of the week!) but as soon as you have four or five tasks in there, you find yourself wishing for a calendar view so you can see them graphically. Another feature that would be nice is to display times along with dates for notes and contact creation. Also, HighRise&#39;s dropboxes work fine with plain text emails, but they strip links out of HTML emails. As a result, those easy-to-use links that IHomefinder provides to log in and see what homes a potential client is looking at go away. A workaround for that is to also forward the lead to a separate shared email account, but naturally that&#39;s a bit of a hack.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Impressions</strong></p>

<p>On balance, for me the simplicity and ease of use of HighRise and its ability to &quot;do the right thing&quot; with a new lead far outweigh the features it lacks. Add to that the fact that getting a team of a half dozen agents up and running will set you back only about $24 per month compared to $210 per month for Top Producer, and HighRise&#39;s minimalism becomes if anything even more exciting. We&#39;re in the middle of rolling it out and I will let you know how it goes!</p>
