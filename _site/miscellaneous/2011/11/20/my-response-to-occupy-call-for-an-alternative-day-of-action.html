          <h2>My Response to Occupy Call for an Alternative Day of Action</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Nov 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I recently left this idea on the <a href="http://www.occupytogether.org/2011/11/19/call-for-an-alternative-day-of-action-on-human-rights-day-saturday-december-10th-2011/">Call for an Alternative Day of Mass Action</a> post on Occupy Togetherâ€™s web site.</p>

<p>While signs and uniforms are interesting visuals that appeal to those who already agree with us, I think it would help grow the movement tremendously if we were always seen acting in Gandhian non-violence and love toward the poor and downtrodden whom we profess to care about. So, for example, carrying a sign -- OK. Carrying a sign (or not) while volunteering in a food kitchen or a free clinic -- awesome.</p>

<p>The problem with &quot;we are the 99% and we want our student loans and mortgages forgiven&quot; is that the portion of 99% who don&#39;t yet agree with us (about 40-ish % at last count) can see through our thin anti-corporatism to find what they see in corporations underneath -- self-interested economic war.</p>

<p>Well, &quot;they&#39;ve waged class war on us all these years&quot; -- though correct historically -- begs the question. Violence on their part returned by violence on ours diminishes us as individuals while it limits our growth as a movement.</p>

<p>Uniforms and signs and other advertising gimmicks are nothing that Corporations don&#39;t already own in spades. Active and consistent acts of kindness and love toward those less fortunate than ourselves are things that will benefit us both personally and as a mass movement.</p>
