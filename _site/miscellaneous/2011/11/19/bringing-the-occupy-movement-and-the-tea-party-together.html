          <h2>Bringing the Occupy Movement and the Tea Party Together</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Nov 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Tea Party members are mad because the government is not functioning right, and crony capitalism interferes with the free market.</p>

<p>The Occupy movement is mad because the government is not functioning right, and crony capitalism interferes with direct representation.</p>

<p>Meantime, the non-functioning government and the businesses that are in bed with them are laughing all the way to the bank, as they watch the two sides fight it out among themselves. Like wolves in the hen house, they gorge themselves on our wealth while those of us who should be protecting the chickens are barking at each other and fighting over scraps.</p>

<p>Our anonymity on the Internet divides us more, allowing us to get a quick mental rush out of sniping at each other with tired clichés that we think represent the rich diversity of human beings in both movements.</p>

<p>And the wolves win.</p>

<p>To my fellow members of the Occupy Movement, I say this: reaching out a hand of friendship to members of the Tea Party – collectively or individually – is an act of active non-violence that will move our agenda forward. It is a deeply spiritual act in the spirit of Gandhi, who said: <em>“Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love.”</em></p>

<p>To our friends in the Tea Party, I say this: I know that many of the people on the right hold sincere and heartfelt religious convictions, and I offer my hand in friendship to all who would work toward the mutual benefit of our common humanity, in the spirit of Matthew 5:44, in which Jesus said, <em>“But I tell you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.”</em></p>

<p>We do not need to minimize or ignore the fundamental and sincere differences we may have on matters of policy, but compared to the common threat we face from a government that represents neither of our interests, our differences are merely the excuses we make to ourselves for not having a better and more just society than the one we have.</p>

<p>You deserve better. We all deserve better. Together we can build something better, but we can’t build a house if we burn down one another’s walls as soon as they go up.</p>

<p>It was Abraham Lincoln (quoting Jesus) who said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand”.</p>

<p>Less famously, it was a popular music group who sang in the 70s:     </p>

<p><em>For united we stand</em></p>

<p><em>Divided we fall</em></p>

<p><em>And if our back should ever be against the wall</em></p>

<p><em>We’ll be together, together you and I.</em></p>
