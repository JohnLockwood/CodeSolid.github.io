          <h2>Dell Studio 17 Review</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Aug 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I’m told that somewhere around the dawn of software development, when processor time was hugely expensive and multiple university departments shared a single computing resource, it was common to have to work out your software problems using a sharpened pencil or similar Flintstones-level tool before your code ever felt the warm embrace of powered silicon.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t know about that. I’m old, but I’m not THAT old.</p>

<p>These days, doing such a thing would be pretty much unthinkable, which is why it’s nice to be able to report that having sacrificed the Windows partition of my desktop machine to the dubious goal of getting faster Ruby on Rails unit tests working, I’m not content to envision my Microsoft Certification on Ubuntu, but have treated myself to a new Dell laptop. It’s a Studio 17”, model s1737-020B, and it’s quite the spiffy little workhorse so far. It’s fairly light for the size and price, has plenty of USB holes so the USB can get in, but also sports an HDMI hole so the digital video can go somewhere – though I must say that even though setting up an extended desktop was the first thing I did, so far I’ve spent most of my time looking at the built-in display for most tasks. It found my wireless network with no fuss at all.</p>

<p>Battery life is supposed to be quite good though I’ve yet to test that. 4 gig of RAM, half a terabyte hard drive, $749 at Best Buy. The front side bus speed is 800 MHz, the two processors runs at 2.1 GHz, so those numbers are a tad lower than some of seen out there, but I don’t think I’ll be doing huge builds just yet so that’s probably all I need, and all things considered I’m very happy with it. Hat tip to the Best Buy folks in Folsom, a very congenial and generally fairly knowledgeable bunch. </p>
