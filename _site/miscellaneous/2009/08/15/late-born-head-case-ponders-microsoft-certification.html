          <h2>Late Born Head Case Ponders Microsoft Certification</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Aug 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>About every six months or so, I completely change platforms and direction in my software career.  That may be because I&#39;m a head case, but if you read &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, you&#39;ll stumble upon the more charitable explanation that as the last born in my family my personality developed with a view to embracing change.</p>

<p>Charity begins at home.</p>

<p>I probably need to get certified, on some level.  I don&#39;t mean I need it or I won&#39;t have a job, per se, although it&#39;s the kind of thing that may open up opportunities around here.  As you might expect, the Sacramento programmer market has a lot of government work going on, and government hiring tends to be driven by the check box.  And of course, being the kind of late born head case that I am, I need to have more opportunities than if I were a conservative first born drudge.</p>

<p>I usually start thinking about certification in response to reaching a trough in fretting about my status.  (The wave itself runs perpetually.)  I have this relentless need to make some pathetic mark on the world, as if that could be done with a keyboard and a Microsoft Certification.  Perhaps fortunately, I&#39;m generally able to suppress my ambition in order to grab whatever tarnished brass ring of a maintenance job happens to fly by my little software hobby horse of life.  It&#39;s a late born head case thing: we know how to make do with hand-me-downs, all the while secretly plotting to someday have our own pair of jeans for once.  As with pants, so with code.</p>

<p>Well, that was maudlin.  Both my older siblings were sisters, so the truth is I got my own clothes.  My parents were wonderful people, and like most folks they weren&#39;t about to go raising any <em>de facto</em> transvestites.</p>

<p>Hey look, if you&#39;re a transvestite, nothing personal, OK?  Jeesh.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I make good on my threat, then I&#39;ll have something to write about.  No longer will I be working on a double secret probation Rails project where I can&#39;t share my code.  Instead, I&#39;ll be working on code so trivial in all but a pedagogical sense that only a Cheney-level paranoid would keep it in a man-sized office safe.</p>

<p>Meet the new blog.  Same as the old blog.</p>
