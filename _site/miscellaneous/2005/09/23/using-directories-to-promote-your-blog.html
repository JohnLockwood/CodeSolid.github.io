          <h2>Using Directories to Promote Your Blog</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Sep 2005</p>

<div class="post">
<p>When promoting your real estate blog -- or any other web site -- one strategy you should definitely not ignore is submitting your site to important directories.   Yahoo and DMOZ are definitely worth submission if serious traffic is in your future, but minor directories can also contribute a boost.  And though incoming links from authority sites with themes related to your site will help your web site most, there&#39;s nothing wrong with getting a few &quot;general&quot; incoming links as well, especially from if the links are free and non-reciprocating.</p>

<p>Although the lists below include many directory types -- reciprocating, non-reciprocating, and paid, I&#39;m an especially big fan of free incoming links.    Assuming your email address isn&#39;t used to spam you (I use a &quot;throwaway&quot; for such purposes), a link that you don&#39;t pay for from a site that doesn&#39;t require you to link back is the closest thing to a free lunch that the Internet has to offer.  Go for it if you can.</p>

<p>An invaluable list I just came across is SEO Company&#39;s list of <a href="http://www.seocompany.ca/directory/top-web-directories.html">Web Directory Resources</a>.  Another excellent resource I&#39;ve used that&#39;s more blog-specific is Google&#39;s <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Weblogs/Directories/">List of Blog Directories</a>.  Real Estate bloggers looking to get noticed should also check out Google&#39;s list of <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Business/Real_Estate/Directories/">Real Estate Directories</a>.</p>
