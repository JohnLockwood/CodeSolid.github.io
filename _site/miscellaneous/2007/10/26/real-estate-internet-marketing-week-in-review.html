          <h2>Real Estate Internet Marketing Week In Review</h2>
<p class="meta">26 Oct 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Real Estate Internet Marketing Week In Review is a new weekly feature where I highlight either the authors and blogs and posts that I found interesting in my reading from the week past or that I thought Realtors® and real estate webmasters should know about.</p>

<p>My series on <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/10/25/real-estate-blogging-platforms-compared-part-3">Comparing Real Estate Blog Platforms</a> was a fairly general overview of real estate blogging options.  A more in depth review of specific blogging software is available in Problogger.net&#39;s <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/15/choosing-a-blog-platform/">Choosing a Blog Platform</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas McMahon, writing for Toprank&#39;s Online Marketing Blog, prepared a handy introduction and <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/10/google-webmaster-tools-review/">review of Google&#39;s Webmaster Tools</a>, which is a free set of tools that helps you see your site as Google does.</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re looking to extend your reach online, get free exposure for a listing, network with your peers, or what have you, an outstanding starting point is Oliver Muoto&#39;s list of <a href="http://www.vflyerblog.com/blog/2007/05/08/real-estate-20/">Web 2.0 Companies Realtors® Should Care About</a>.</p>

<p>My own marketing philosophy is summed up neatly in the equation SEO + IDX = $$$.  For those of you who think you have an online image that needs to be nurtured, however, Bobby Carroll has an interesting article on <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/248117/Digital-Brand-Management-Your">Digital Brand Management</a>.  Again, I offer this position not because I agree with it, but in spite of that.  PT Barnum is reported to have said &quot;I don&#39;t care what they say about me as long as they spell my name right.&quot;  I might paraphrase:  &quot;I don&#39;t care what <em>they</em> say about me as long as my marketing is successful enough that you&#39;re reading what _I _say about me.&quot;</p>

<p>And now for something that I _do _agree with, Brad Carroll recently posted this <a href="http://www.dakno.com/blog/thinking-about-requiring-users-to-sign-up/">outstanding article</a> on why you should not force your users to register before allowing them access to your IDX web site listings.  I&#39;ve agreed with this opinion for years because of the money I&#39;ve made specifically from people who told me not having to register was why they chose me.  Brad takes this a step further and explains the psychology and reasoning behind this.</p>

<p>Finally, my friends at Sellsius Real Estate <a href="http://blog.sellsiusrealestate.com/marketing-real-estate-agents/real-estate-transfer-taxes-for-every-state/2007/10/21/">posted</a> this worthwhile blogging tip:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are a real estate broker or agent, <strong>do a post on closing costs</strong>, with a breakdown of real estate transfer taxes, and estimated costs, and <strong>put it permanently in the sidebar</strong>. Every serious buyer or seller will click it. You betcha. It’s a good way to market your real estate expertise.</p>
