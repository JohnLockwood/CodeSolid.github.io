<p>Wow, it&#39;s hard to believe it, but it&#39;s been over a year since my last Internet Marketing Post.</p>

<p>This is not the way to run a successful blog.  I consider myself duly chastised.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to me to note how October comes, and when October comes all the Realtors® start slowing down and writing e-book projects.  Last year I <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2006/10/05/the-ebook-project/">threatened one</a>, but fortunately for Western Civilization the threat was a hollow one.</p>

<p>This year <a href="http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com/2007/09/call-for-submissions.html">Purva is working on one</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What happened to last year&#39;s e-book</strong></p>

<p>What happened to last year&#39;s e-book was that things actually got busy again after October.  In November and December, things had started to take off.  Then by about February, I&#39;d pretty much forgotten that I was supposed to be growing a &quot;new business&quot; doing Internet marketing services for Realtors®.  I put &quot;new business&quot; in scare quotes because this is really my current business as well, it&#39;s just that in my current business, I do it for one customer, my own brokerage.</p>

<p>How well that&#39;s going is that I&#39;ve been fortunate to enjoy #1 search results for some pretty important keyword combinations on major search engines.  Not just first page results, but top of the first page results.  I like those.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary, but to my way of thinking there&#39;s just no reason to even get started on an Internet marketing campaign if you can&#39;t dominate a niche.  That&#39;s where you should be heading.  Your site should be generating leads for you.  If it&#39;s not, fix it or fire it.</p>
