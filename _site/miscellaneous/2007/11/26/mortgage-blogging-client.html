<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m pleased to announce that I&#39;m currently beginning work on a blog installation and training program for for Peter Thompson, a <a href="http://www.ptmortgage.com/ng.html">Chicago Loan Officer</a>. Peter and I met through a comment I made on ActiveRain and we hit it off right away, because I was able to provide him with a low cost and personalized set of services to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve the Search Engine Optimization of his existing web site.</li>
<li>Research effective key words to use for his web site and blog.</li>
<li>Install a Wordpress blog based on a standard template, with some customization to the template.</li>
<li>Suggest strategies for blogging topics, attracting more visitors (both customers and colleagues that can contribute to the blog&#39;s success), etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on some of the writing I&#39;ve seen from him both on his newly launched site and his <a href="http://activerain.com/blogs/pt1111">Active Rain blog</a> and his &quot;in it for the long haul&quot; attitude, I expect that it won&#39;t be long before his new blog will ultimately serve as a major resource for Illinois home finance information.</p>
