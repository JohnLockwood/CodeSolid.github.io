<p>There is a lot of experimentation going on in Web 2.0 -- people trying out new things.  For the most part that&#39;s a good thing, but it can make the task of Internet marketing seem a bit dizzying.</p>

<p>If you read a few bloggers, especially, you&#39;ll develop a bizarre set of modernistic sounding marching orders.  You&#39;re told  you need to &quot;find your voice&quot; and &quot;establish yourself as an expert&quot; and develop a following of &quot;raving fans&quot; by being more &quot;transparent&quot; and taking part in a &quot;social community&quot;.</p>

<p>If you feel like that&#39;s a bit too much to take, don&#39;t worry, so do I.  Let&#39;s see if we can simplify things a bit, shall we?</p>

<p><strong>If You Can Count To Two, You Can Be Successful</strong></p>

<p>To be successful at Internet marketing for real estate you need to do two things:</p>

<p>Thing 1) Get people who want to buy or sell real estate to find you.</p>

<p>Thing 2) Get people to buy or sell with you once they&#39;ve found you.</p>

<p>I promise you, word of honor as a guy with a picture of a nut on his post:  that&#39;s all you need to do.</p>

<p>Sometimes I boil this down into a one line formula, SEO + IDX = $$$, but that only represents my favorite solutions to thing one and thing two.</p>

<p>Of course, the story gets a lot more interesting (and more complicated) when you start really looking into how to do things 1 and thing 2, but that&#39;s the basic formula.</p>

<p>Whenever I have spent time productively online, I was focused on one or both of these two things.</p>

<p>Whenever I have dropped the ball or wasted time or gone up a blind alley, the solution was to get focused back on one of these two things.</p>
