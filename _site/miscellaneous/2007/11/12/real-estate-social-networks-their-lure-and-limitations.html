          <h2>Real Estate Social Networks -- Their Lure and Limitations</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Nov 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I spend quite a bit of time on a few different social networks.  Most recently I&#39;ve been reviewing Cre8Buzz here.  Yet I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on social networks because I think they&#39;re productive, so as you can guess I think maybe I should be spending less time there.  In general I think you get significantly more benefit from writing a blog post or page on a web site you control, as opposed to writing it on a social network.  Still, like the proverbial glass of wine with dinner, most non-alcoholics won&#39;t be too harmed by a moderate use of social networks, and may even derive a certain health benefit.</p>

<p>From a search perspective, content on a social network site has an important limitation that content on your own web site does not.  This limitation is that your content may appear several links away from the main page.  Because of this, even your profile page not be indexed by the search engine for some time after you&#39;ve been active -- let alone any brilliantly conceived blog posts you&#39;re letting loose on the world.  I&#39;ve yet to see my Cre8Buzz Profile get indexed by either Yahoo or Google, for example.</p>

<p>In addition to being indexed slowly (if at all), although the the community may have collected considerable page rank, being several links away from the home page means that this value is likely to be watered down fairly thoroughly by the time it gets to you.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the example of a blog.  Let&#39;s see how far away from the home page your blog appears in three different scenarios:</p>

<p>Scenario:  Stand alone blog.
Links:  0.  (By definition, in this case your home page is your blog).</p>

<p>Scenario:  Integrated web site and blog.
Links:  1.  (User comes to your home page, clicks on &quot;Blog Link&quot;, and there they are.</p>

<p>Scenario:  ActiveRain.  Assume you&#39;ve been posting enough there that you&#39;re on page one for your county.  Otherwise add links.
Links:  4   Home --&gt; State --&gt; County --&gt; Your Profile --&gt; Your Blog</p>

<p>On the positive side, if you choose a real estate community (as opposed to a general community like Cre8Buzz), you get an advantage from being part of a huge site that has a great deal of &quot;thematic content&quot; about your subject.  This would not be the case if you participate in a general community like Facebook or Cre8Buzz.  I have also noticed that the search engines don&#39;t seem to index content on the more general social networks as readily as they do the content on more theme-based sites.</p>

<p>The other positive benefit you derive from posting on social networks is the opportunity to provide some link love for your main web site or blog.  However, it&#39;s easy to overstate the benefit from this, since traditional wisdom is that the search engines like to see incoming links from a variety of sources.  Thus, 10 blog posts on your main site with 10 incoming links from your ActiveRain blog are likely to receive less of a benefit than would 10 blog posts with 10 different sites linking to them.  And remember, incoming links only count for reputation -- in terms of page rank, a link is a link is a link, and a page on your web site or blog will naturally have a lot more internal links to different pages on your site, and fewer links pointing to the rest of someone else&#39;s site.</p>
