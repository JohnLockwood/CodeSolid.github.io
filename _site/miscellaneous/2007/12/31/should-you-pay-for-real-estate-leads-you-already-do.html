          <h2>Should You Pay For Real Estate Leads? You Already Do.</h2>
<p class="meta">31 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>A lot of Realtors® complain about lead generating services, many of which have aggressive and misleading sales tactics.  For example, you haven&#39;t been in business very long if you haven&#39;t fielded a call offering you a unique opportunity to lock in your exclusive territory before someone else does.  For only $400 per month, let&#39;s say, you can own the zip code 95682 on the world famous SellMeAHouseNowPrettyPlease.com.  Of course, it may turn out that SellMeAHouseNowPrettyPlease.com generates a lead for 95682 every 174 years, in which case you&#39;ve paid $835,200 for the opportunity to generate a $25,000 commission by the year 2181.</p>

<p>Most of us would agree that there are more effective ad buys one could make.</p>

<p>In addition to the bad feeling left by scam operators like this, many Realtors® object to the idea of such big-budget &quot;real estate interlopers&quot; charging them for the privilege of doing transactions that would otherwise be &quot;theirs&quot;.  Of course, embedded in that objection is the naive idea that if Realtor.com and Yahoo Real Estate weren&#39;t around, you&#39;d be at the top of the search engine enjoying the well deserved fruits of your license.  Enter scam artist #2, who&#39;ll &quot;guarantee&quot; to put you there.  Again, for a very modest fee.</p>

<p><strong>My Early Revelation</strong></p>

<p>When I&#39;d been in the business maybe four months or so, I was working my broker&#39;s &quot;floor time&quot; one day when this short, old, bald guy who worked in my office came in and offered to sell me some leads &quot;from his web site&quot; -- 30% referral fee on the first one and 25% thereafter.  Now at the time I was failing in real estate after about ten years of (for the most part) succeeding in professional software development.  Though I hadn&#39;t yet seriously begun marketing to consumers online at this point, it took me about a minute and twenty-three seconds to figure out that if the short old bald guy could generate enough leads from the Internet to sell them off, Johnnie software developer could figure out how to the same thing, being younger, taller, still in possession of my hair, etc.</p>

<p>For the next several months, and for many, many hours over the five intervening years, I worked on surpassing this fellow&#39;s business model, beating him first at his own search engine positions and later acquiring more valuable ones which into which he hadn&#39;t even made inroads.  SEO plus IDX was the basic formula, then as now.</p>

<p>It took a lot of time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I could replicate a lot of what I did today, but fortunately, as in the military, it&#39;s significantly easier to defend an entrenched position than it is to attack one.</p>

<p><strong>A Balanced Model</strong></p>

<p>As much as I have swung from the extreme of potential lead consumer to &quot;interloper&quot; (which is another word for broker, by the way), I admit that there are two limitations to my own marketing strategy.</p>

<p>The first is that it is extremely time and labor intensive, and it hasn&#39;t gotten any easier to do.  I don&#39;t think I could replicate a lot of what I did today, but fortunately, as in the military, it&#39;s significantly easier to defend an entrenched position than it is to attack one.  On the flip side, this means potential growth is harder to achieve.</p>

<p>The second limitation is that there&#39;s no guarantee that major search engines will continue to rank me as they do now.</p>

<p>I believe that the problem with paying for leads is not that the big bad interlopers make us do it.  We&#39;re always doing it, one way or another -- even when we buy yard signs or business cards.  What&#39;s truly at issue is how much do we have to pay, and what&#39;s the return on what we pay?</p>

<p>I admit, I don&#39;t have the specific numbers to tell tell you what the &quot;right answer&quot; here is.  All I can suggest is keeping an open mind to the different ways to generate business online.  I have used both pay-per-click and SEO to good effect, and I would definitely add pay-per-click into the mix if you need to start getting leads in right away.  I also wouldn&#39;t discount well known lead resellers like HomeGain, though I need to learn more about this aspect of the business.  If you&#39;ve used these firms successfully, please let me know.</p>
