          <h2>Creating Your Own Internet Real Estate</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>When I first got into Real Estate, I came from a background in software development (including, most recently, web site development).  Because of this background, as soon as I learned that people were meeting real estate clients on-line, it became my goal to create a profitable web site.  Soon afterwards, I set out to create and maintain several profitable web sites.</p>

<p>When I first heard about blogging in 2003, I thought of blogging software as a way to do help me do just that.  They say if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see everything as a nail.  In my case I saw my task as content development, so every type of software I looked to me like a content management system.</p>

<p>With the rise of social networking, I began noticing a shift away from creating your own content on your own site to hanging around with your friends.  In the last year or so, I&#39;ve been repeatedly surprised by the extent to which people -- including my colleagues, other Realtors® -- are content to rent instead of own their online properties.  This was driven home today by an outstanding article by CopyBlogger&#39;s Brian Clark, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/are-you-someones-user-generated-content/">Are You Someone&#39;s User Generated Content?</a>  Clark points to many articles by leading bloggers discussing the regrets people have felt when they neglected their own Internet properties -- their blogs -- to explore social networking.</p>

<p>Clark sums up my own feelings about frittering one&#39;s time on Facebook, (or mismanaging it on MySpace, if you prefer):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me, there’s really no appeal in spending a lot of time creating “user-generated” content via a social networking application. That’s like remodeling the kitchen in a house you rent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This metaphor should be especially apt to Realtors®, who know first hand the benefits our clients can derive from their own sweat equity.</p>

<p>Is your sweat equity being invested in your own online real estate, or are you remodeling someone else&#39;s kitchen for free?</p>
