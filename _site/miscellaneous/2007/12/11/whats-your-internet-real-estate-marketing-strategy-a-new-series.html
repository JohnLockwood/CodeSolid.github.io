<p class="meta">11 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>One of the things that always interests me is hearing from others about what sorts of things they&#39;re doing to make business happen.  Naturally, the piece that I&#39;m most interested in is what sort of things they&#39;re doing on the Internet to make things happen, since Internet real estate marketing is my passion, specialty, and business.</p>

<p>Those who&#39;ve read me know that I have some pretty strong opinions as to what one&#39;s strategy _should _be, and about what works and what doesn&#39;t.  But the reason it&#39;s so interesting to hear from others is that I certainly don&#39;t think what I&#39;m doing is the only way to get it right.  I&#39;m passionate about sharing what I am doing because it&#39;s worked so well, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only thing that works.  There are other approaches that either are completely different or complementary.  Even while I&#39;m working on my core strategy, I always find myself wondering if there isn&#39;t some other technique or project I should be incorporating to help my business grow.</p>

<p>What I&#39;d like to do in a future post, therefore, is to try to take a really comprehensive look at my own marketing strategy, and talk about what I think works and what I&#39;ve always felt were the strengths as well as the limitations of my approach.  After that, I&#39;m going to be inviting other RealtorsÂ® and mortgage brokers to share what sorts of approaches have worked for them.  I&#39;ll put together a list of questions as a guide for authors so that you won&#39;t have to start completely from scratch unless you want to.  I already have some ideas in mind about people I&#39;d like to invite, but if you have some ideas and would like to contribute an article on this topic, <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/contact">please let me know</a>.</p>
