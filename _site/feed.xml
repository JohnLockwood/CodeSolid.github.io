&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a one of the most popular test automation tools.  Selenium lets you write automated tests to drive a variety of popular browsers including Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Using Selenium IDE, you can record browser sessions and export the recorded tests to test cases written in a variety of languages.  These languages include Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first part of our Selenium and IntelliJ Idea tutorial, we&amp;#39;ll cover working with the IDE itself in Firefox.  We&amp;#39;ll learn how to record a web session, and
how to locate and test web elements on the page.  In part two of the article, we&amp;#39;ll learn how to take our Selenium tests to the next level by turning them into 
JUnit tests running in IntelliJ Idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Setup&quot; name=&quot;Setup&quot;&gt;Setting up Firebug and Selenium IDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Selenium IDE is an extension for Firefox that should serve as your starting point for your Selenium work.  So of course, you&amp;#39;ll need Firefox installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting Selenium, however, there&amp;#39;s also one more tool we&amp;#39;ll need if you don&amp;#39;t already have it, Firebug.  Among other things, Firebug makes it easy to examine page elements, something which we&amp;#39;ll be doing a lot as we dig into Selenium.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfirebug.com/&quot;&gt;Download Firebug&lt;/a&gt; from this site and install it.  Once it&amp;#39;s installed, you should see a little bug on the Firefox menu bar, click it to open Firebug.  We&amp;#39;ll be using it in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;re ready to get the Selenium IDE from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/&quot;&gt;Selenium Download Page&lt;/a&gt;.  Selenium IDE will appear as an option on the tools menu.  In recent versions, you can also access it from the right hand menu button as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/FirefoxMenuButtonSelenium.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Selenium Firefox menu button&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally open Selenium in a sidebar, but opening as a Popup is the more common option that&amp;#39;s available in all environments.  Shown below is how that looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/SeleniumScreenShot1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Selenium IDE Pop Up&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;SimpleSeleniumTestcase&quot; name=&quot;SimpleSeleniumTestCase&quot;&gt;A Simple Selenium Test Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s dive right in to Selenium with a simple test case.  Make sure that the red recording button in the upper right is &amp;quot;On&amp;quot; as shown in the image above.  You can toggle it if you&amp;#39;re not sure -- the &amp;quot;On&amp;quot; state is when it looks pushed in.  Next, in the Selenium window&amp;#39;s address bar, where it says &amp;quot;Base URL&amp;quot;, let&amp;#39;s enter:  https://github.com/codesolid . One thing to notice at this point is that Selenium will not automatically go to the base URL.  You&amp;#39;ll need to navigate it in the firefox address bar as well.  This is because really what we&amp;#39;re entering here is the URL of the &amp;quot;Web Application Under Test&amp;quot; -- in other words, we&amp;#39;re telling Selenium where to record our activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun begins when you navigate a page under that base URL.  On the CodeSolid github page, there should be a link to a &amp;quot;tutorials&amp;quot; project.  Let&amp;#39;s click on that link in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox navigates to the link, but if you&amp;#39;ll notice, the Selenium IDE has now recorded your activity.  At this point the Selenium IDE window should look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/SeleniumScreenShot2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Selenium Test Recording&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you toggle the recording button to the &amp;quot;Off state&amp;quot;, you should be able to prove you&amp;#39;ve recorded your session by playing it back.  First, in the window that&amp;#39;s viewing the CodeSolid tutorials, navigate to somewhere on the web that&amp;#39;s not as popular as the CodeSolid tutorials, like Google for example.  Now, back in the Selenium IDE window, underneath the Base URL bar, you should see two green play buttons.  Click either of these (at this point it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which).  You should see Firefox navigate back to the CodeSolid Github account and click through to the tutorials page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;LocatingWebElements&quot; name=&quot;LocatingWebElements&quot;&gt;Locating Web Elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As interesting as it is, a recorded web session is not yet a test.  It has the first part -- a description in code of the steps that take place -- but we haven&amp;#39;t yet added a way to compare some expected value to an actual value.  Let&amp;#39;s add a simple check to see if some element on the page contains the text we expect it to.  On the CodeSolid tutorials page, if you scroll down past the links to the tutorials, there&amp;#39;s a readme file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/CodeSolidReadme.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;CodeSolid Readme&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github displays this in an H1 tag, but to make sure we&amp;#39;re finding the right H1 tag, let&amp;#39;s open firebug using the firebug button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/FirebugButton.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Firebug&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens up the firebug window, as you can see below.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/FirebugWindow.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Firebug&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve added an arrow to point out the inspect button.  With the HTML tab selected as shown in the picture, if you click the inspect button, you&amp;#39;ll notice if you hover over any element on the page in the browser window, you&amp;#39;ll seee the HTML for that element displaying in the HTML window.  You can then select that element by clicking on it.  Let&amp;#39;s go ahead and click first on the inspect button, then in the main browser window, click the header, &amp;quot;Welcome to the CodeSolid Tutorials&amp;quot;, that we scrolled to earlier.  This selects the html for the page element we want to verify.  There are a variety of ways to do this, but one of the most versatile is to use a CSS selector.  With the element we want still selected, if you right click on the html displayed in the firebug window you should see a menu that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/FirebugPopupWithCSSPath.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Using a CSS Path Selector&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &amp;quot;Copy CSS Path&amp;quot;.  At this point the CSS path for the element is copied to the clipboard.  If you were to paste it into a text editor, youd see something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&quot;html body.logged_out.env-production.windows.vis-public div.wrapper div.site div.container div.repository-with-sidebar.repo-container.new-discussion-timeline.js-new-discussion-timeline.with-full-navigation div#js-repo-pjax-container.repository-content.context-loader-container div#readme.clearfix.announce.instapaper_body.md article.markdown-body.entry-content h1&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents the entire CSS path to the element.  As you work with Selenium, you may find that your tests are less brittle if you only consider what elements you need at the &lt;b&gt;end&lt;/b&gt; of the path -- that way other parts of the page can change and your tests will still work.  For example, in this case, using the section &amp;quot;article.markdown-body.entry-content h1&amp;quot; identifies the element just fine.  For now, however, let&amp;#39;s just take the whole path and see how to get Selenium to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;VerifyingExpectedResults&quot; name=&quot;VerifyingExpectedResults&quot;&gt;Verifying Expected Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the CSS for our web element copiled to the clipboard, we can now turn our recording of a Firefox session into a real test.  If you look at the Selenium IDE window,
you should see on the right hand side of it two tabs labeled &amp;quot;Table&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot;. The Table tab shows the Selenium commands that will run if you run the test.  So far all it has are recorded commands -- now we&amp;#39;re going to add a command ourselves.  If you right click just underneath the command that says &amp;quot;clickAndWait   link=tutorials&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll can then click &amp;quot;Insert New Command&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that underneath the Table itself there are three entry fields (that are highlighted in the image below):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20140606/SeleniumTableTab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Selenium Table Tab&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three fields correspond to the three columns of the table, Command, Target, and Value.  You select or type Selenium commands in the first field, so in that field enter &amp;quot;assertText&amp;quot;.  In the second field, start by typing &amp;quot;css=&amp;quot;, then just after the &amp;quot;css=&amp;quot;, copy the CSS path that we copied from Firebug earlier.  This creates a &amp;quot;locator&amp;quot; expression that will get passed to the assertText function.  You can test that you did this step successfully by clicking on the Find button -- if your locator is working properly you should see the &amp;quot;Welcome to the CodeSolid Tutorials&amp;quot; header flash yellow briefly.  Finally, in the third field, simply type &amp;quot;Welcome to the CodeSolid Tutorials&amp;quot;  Note that for all three fields you should type the text without the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, if you navigate to another page like Google and re-run your test in the Selenium IDE (clicking one the green play arrows), you should see the test navigate to the tutorials page, and you should see a green bar on the assertText command you entered.  The test passed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;LastSteps&quot; name=&quot;LastSteps&quot;&gt;Final Steps and What&#39;s Ahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our next tutorial, we&amp;#39;ll get into how to use what we&amp;#39;ve created as the basis for a JUnit test suite using IntelliJ idea.  But before moving on, as a final step let&amp;#39;s save our test.  In the Selenium IDE, select File / Save Test Case to save your file.  Notice anything special about the file format that Selenium used to save the test file?  It&amp;#39;s just regular HTML (well, OK, it&amp;#39;s XHTML), with the name of the test in the first row and the Selenium &amp;quot;script&amp;quot; in the remaining table rows.  The
base URL is cleverly stuffed away in the head tag.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tool for testing HTML that stores files as HTML?  Don&amp;#39;t worry -- the universe is not folding back on itself.  Selenium is just cool!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Goalboost - Hours Tracking for Sofware Projects</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the cool business models, writing a SaaS application and selling it directly to consumers has to rank among the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m a few hundred hours away from that goal, but at least I have a cool place to track those hours, Goalboost.  It&amp;#39;s the ultimate in eating your own dog food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://codesolid.com/images/20140511/Goalboost_Screenshot_05112014.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I worked on an Indiegogo campaign and the task above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such tasty, tasty dog food.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>We are moving</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For some time now my ParticleWave site has been fairly schizophrenic, being also JohnLockwood.com and Codesolid.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to the lack of mental health around this site, I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to move the whole site to Jekyll for some time,
because I&amp;#39;m tired of wordpress updates and stupid spam comments.  In other words, I&amp;#39;m moving from Wordpress to Jekyll for the same reason 
everybody moves from Wordpress to Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this post, my site is live on Github pages, as you can see if you&amp;#39;re reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a LOT involved in making the move, and I took lousy notes.  So this is not a tutorial, or not much of one -- sorry.  It&amp;#39;s more of an announcement for the one or two people who are kind enough to read me from time to time.   Getting Wordpress to Jekyll was one nasty little bit of business which I have forgotten since I did it weeks ago.  I do recall that it started with Google and involved typing, so I&amp;#39;m sure if you&amp;#39;re smart you can reproduce it.  More recently I&amp;#39;m able to credit David Ensinger&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/&quot;&gt;fine article&lt;/a&gt; on how to workaround the fact that your plugins are likely not supported by Github.  Nice job there and helpful,
and my own stripped down version of his Rakefile is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/tree/source&quot;&gt;source for this site&lt;/a&gt;.  My version
works around some issues I had (I found I had to force the pushes to master for some reason), and it removes some of the sass-specific stuff he had added 
since I&amp;#39;m not using sass at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it&amp;#39;s nice to have a starter site here I can begin to build out.  You&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s a lot to be done, the pages are just stubs, etc., etc.  There&amp;#39;s no domain actually pointing here yet, though we&amp;#39;ll work on having it be CodeSolid.com before too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now finally I have a place for the blog posts to go, so I can keep writing.  For about two months I&amp;#39;ve written very little on ParticleWave since I know it&amp;#39;s going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can feed my keyboard addition again.  &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Testing the Rake Post Task</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I just merged some tasks from Ellen Gummesson&amp;#39;s cool Rake Boilerplate, and once that was done, started this post based on nothing
more complex than &amp;#39;rake[&amp;quot;Testing the Rake Post Task&amp;quot;]&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very cool.  Nice job, Ellen, and thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rakefile with David Ensinger&amp;#39;s work on building Jekyll sites locally and working around the fact that Github doesn&amp;#39;t support most plugins, together with some of Ellen&amp;#39;s post-creating magic is located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/blob/source/Rakefile&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using TestNG with Spring</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Testing Spring in JUnit is fairly simple given the test runner support.  Using TestNG is a little bit more complex, but this tutorial will quickly get you up to speed.
&lt;div id=&quot;table_of_contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul &gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#MovingToTestNGfromJUnit&quot;&gt;Moving to TestNG from JUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#SettingUpMaven&quot;&gt;Setting Up The Maven Dependency for TestNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#SimpleTests&quot;&gt;Some Simple AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests Examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;MovingToTestNGfromJUnit&quot; id=&quot;MovingToTestNGfromJUnit&quot;&gt;Moving to TestNG from JUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2013/05/16/spring-unit-testing-using-junit/&quot;&gt;Simple Introduction to Spring Unit testing using JUnit&lt;/a&gt;.  We&amp;#39;ve been using JUnit quite a bit in our examples so far, but as some of you may already know, JUnit is not the only unit test framework for Java.  Another framework, TestNG, offers a lot of features that JUnit lacks, such as the ability to run parameterized tests in which a given test is run against an array of different values, and the ability to break tests down into categories coupled with fine-grained configuration control over what tests to run.  Indeed, the author of TestNG (&amp;quot;Next Generation&amp;quot;) very much had the limitations of JUnit in mind in writing the new framework.  You can read about some of the problems with JUnit that TestNG was designed to solve on it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://testng.org/&quot;&gt;TestNG web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the choice of which technology to use is often a matter not of what&amp;#39;s best, but what&amp;#39;s most popular (especially if you&amp;#39;re early in your career and need to get certain key technologies added to your resume).  So for my wife, who&amp;#39;s just beginning her technical career as a tester, I&amp;#39;d be inclined to recommend JUnit, whereas for myself, old fart programmer that I am, I have the luxury of picking the technology I consider better in many cases.  For example, compared to IntelliJ Idea, for me Eclipse is just too painful -- free or not, big market share or not.  So I use IntelliJ.  So if you&amp;#39;re playing &amp;quot;Dice Keyword Bingo&amp;quot;, stick with JUnit, otherwise do yourself a favor and take a look at TestNG.  &lt;/My two cents&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;SettingUpMaven&quot; id=&quot;SettingUpMaven&quot;&gt;Setting Up The Maven Dependency for TestNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting up the Maven Dependency for TestNG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than repeat all the sample bean code from our &lt;a href=&quot;=&quot;&gt;original JUnit article&lt;/a&gt;, let&amp;#39;s focus here on the tests. The original sample code is, after all, not very interesting -- it only gave us something to test.  To migrate the JUnit sample, the first thing I needed to do was change the dependency section in our POM file slightly.  Remove the JUnit dependency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;junit
  junit
  4.8.2
  test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now add the dependency for TestNG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;org.testng
  testng
  6.1.1
  test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those of you starting from scratch, the here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials/blob/master/SpringTestNG/pom.xml&quot;&gt;the full POM file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;SimpleTests&quot; id=&quot;SimpleTests&quot;&gt;Some Simple AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests Examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Simple AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests Test Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#39;s see what we need to do to use Spring&amp;#39;s basic TestNG testing support class, AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests.  Don&amp;#39;t let the &amp;quot;Abstract&amp;quot; in the name scare you off here, there&amp;#39;s really nothing much to implement. All you need to do is add a ContextConfiguration annotation to your class and it just works.  Here&amp;#39;s the Hello-World-simple example, which only uses the ContextConfiguration annotation to get it to compile and run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package com.codesolid.tutorials.tests;

import org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import static org.testng.Assert.assertTrue;

@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;file:src/main/resources/spring-config.xml&amp;quot;)
public class SimpleTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {

    @Test
    public void SomeTest() {
        assertTrue(true);
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying our JUnit tests to work with TestNG was just as easy.  The @RunWith annotation was no longer needed, being replaced by the fact that we&amp;#39;re extending AbstractTestNGSpringContextTexts.  So  pretty much the only migration we did involved changing JUnit imports to TestNG ones.  We removed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We replaced it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;import org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import static org.testng.Assert.*;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here for example is a little bit longer example, that exercises some of the test beans we&amp;#39;ve wired up in our application context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package com.codesolid.tutorials.tests;

// Generally needed:
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import static org.testng.Assert.*;

// Application specific
import com.codesolid.tutorials.UserStory;
import com.codesolid.tutorials.User;

@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;file:src/main/resources/spring-config.xml&amp;quot;)
public class ContextTests extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {

    @SuppressWarnings(&amp;quot;SpringJavaAutowiringInspection&amp;quot;)
    @Autowired
    protected ApplicationContext ac;

    // Using ApplicationContext
    // The getBean method is the workhorse of the Spring ApplicationContext.
    // The user field in the UserStory object was set up (dependency injected)
    // by Spring:
    @Test
    public void testUserNotNull() {
        UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
        assertNotNull(story.getUser());
    }

    // Not using ApplicationContext
    // Regular non-Spring instantiation
    // Instantiating our own UserStory, you can see that the user
    // is null.
    @Test
    public void testUserStoryNotFromContext() {
        UserStory story = new UserStory();
        assertNull(story.getUser());
    }

    // Not using ApplicationContext
    // Regular non-Spring instantiation
    // The default role if you just call the constructor
    // is &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;.
    @Test
    public void testNonSpringUserDefaultRole()
    {
        User u = new User();
        assertEquals(u.getRole(), &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;);
    }

    // Using ApplicationContext
    // Since Spring instantiated this according to the property
    // from spring-config.xml, it overrode the default &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;
    // role with &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;.  (This presumably
    // is Wile E. Coyote.)
    @Test
    public void testUserRoleIsAsExpected() {
        UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
        assertEquals(story.getUser().getRole(), &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;);
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started using the Spring TestNG support turned out to be really easy.  Check our our IntelliJ project and the full source on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials/tree/master/SpringTestNG&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction -- My Scandalous Confession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin with the tutorial, I am going to lay bare my soul to you.  I know, most tutorials are dry and boring, and don&amp;#39;t include such titillating and scandalous gossip as you are about to hear. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I write an article that has Part 1 in the title, I generally am doing so without even a remote business plan for a clue about how many parts I&amp;#39;m going to end up with.  There, I&amp;#39;ve made my confession.  Eat your heart out, St. Augustine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we&amp;#39;re going to start digging into Spring Security in the easiest way I know how.  First, spend $199 on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/&quot;&gt;great Java IDE&lt;/a&gt;, or download it free for thirty days so you can get through however many parts this article ends up having.  We&amp;#39;re using IntelliJ 12 Ultimate Edition to generate a starter project for this article in the next section.  The cool thing is, though, once you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials/tree/master/SpringSecurity1&quot;&gt;starter project&lt;/a&gt;, you can likely follow along with the rest of the article using either the IntelliJ Idea 11 or 12 Community Edition, which is free. I&amp;#39;ve had good luck doing that. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2013/05/17/how-to-run-the-codesolid-tutorials-in-eclipse/&quot;&gt;import the POM file into Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and run the project that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;GeneratingAProject&quot; name=&quot;GeneratingAProject&quot;&gt;Generating a Spring Security Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Idea Ultimate Edition Version 12 and later, to create a Spring Security Project you simply select create a new project from the Welcome Screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IntelliJCreateNewProject.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IntelliJCreateNewProject&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, select Spring Security and give your project a name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SpringSecurityCreateProject1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SpringSecurityCreateProject&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;SecurityConfiguration&quot; name=&quot;SecurityConfiguration&quot;&gt;The Security Configuration Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Spring security starter project, IntelliJ adds the security-related configuration to the two required places, web.xml, and the main Spring configuration file, both of which are in src\webapp\WEB-INF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In web.xml, we first set up a security filter name, then use that name to defining a mapping to ensure that all application URLs go through the security filter first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;filter&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;filter-name&amp;gt;springSecurityFilterChain&amp;lt;/filter-name&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;filter-class&amp;gt;org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy&amp;lt;/filter-class&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/filter&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;filter-mapping&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;filter-name&amp;gt;springSecurityFilterChain&amp;lt;/filter-name&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;url-pattern&amp;gt;/*&amp;lt;/url-pattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/filter-mapping&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we turn to the main Spring configuration file, spring-config.xml, which is shown in abbreviated form below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;security:global-method-security jsr250-annotations=&amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot; pre-post-annotations=&amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot; secured-annotations=&amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;security:http use-expressions=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:intercept-url pattern=&amp;quot;/**&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;permitAll&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:form-login /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:logout logout-success-url=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; delete-cookies=&amp;quot;JSESSIONID&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:remember-me /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:session-management invalid-session-url=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;security:concurrency-control max-sessions=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; error-if-maximum-exceeded=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/security:session-management&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/security:http&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;encoder&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;security:authentication-manager&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:authentication-provider&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;security:password-encoder ref=&amp;quot;encoder&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;security:user-service&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;!-- Password: &amp;quot;koala&amp;quot; for both --&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;security:user name=&amp;quot;user&amp;quot;
                  password=&amp;quot;4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde&amp;quot;
                  authorities=&amp;quot;user&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;security:user name=&amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;
                  password=&amp;quot;4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde&amp;quot;
                  authorities=&amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/security:user-service&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/security:authentication-provider&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/security:authentication-manager&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we see a line enabling JSR-250 annotations, such as @RolesAllowed, @PermitAll, @DenyAll, which allows fine-grained, method level access control.  Furthermore, the &amp;#39;use-expressions=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;#39; clause allows us to use Spring Expression Language style security expressions in our view layer. We&amp;#39;ll be looking at what that allows us to do a bit further on when we discuss the view layer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the attributes &amp;#39;pre-post-annotations=&amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot;&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;secured-annotations=&amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot;&amp;#39; will be used by our controllers.  These configuration elements enable a feature that is new as of Spring 3.0.  Spring 3.0 introduced several new, method-level annotations beginning with @Pre and @Post.  We see one of these, @PreAuthorize, used in both the UserService class and the ApplicationController classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;// In UserService.java:
    @PreAuthorize(&amp;quot;hasRole(&amp;#39;admin&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;)
    public Collection getAuthorities(UserDetails userDetails) {
        return userDetails.getAuthorities();
    }

    // In ApplicationController.java:
    @PreAuthorize(&amp;quot;hasRole(&amp;#39;admin&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;)
    @RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/admin&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String admin(ModelMap map) {
        UserDetails userDetails =
                (UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();
        Collection securedMessage = userService.getAuthorities(userDetails);
        map.addAttribute(&amp;quot;userDetails&amp;quot;, userDetails);
        map.addAttribute(&amp;quot;userAuthorities&amp;quot;, securedMessage);
        return &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;;
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next section of the configuration, we see a setting that is probably worth giving some thought to before you move an application into production:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;security:http use-expressions=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;security:intercept-url pattern=&amp;quot;/**&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;permitAll&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
        ...
   &amp;lt;/security:http&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demo app takes the unusual approach of allowing access by default, and allowing it for certain roles.  Generally it&amp;#39;s considered a best practice for secure applications to deny access by default, then turn it on selectively -- that way when you forget a setting somewhere, you err on the side of more security, not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;StandardPasswordEncoder&quot; name=&quot;StandardPasswordEncoder&quot;&gt;Spring&#39;s StandardPasswordEncoder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next two sections of spring-config.xml, we set the password encoder our application will use to the StandardPasswordEncoder, then we configure two users with passwords generated by that encoder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;...
&amp;lt;security:user-service&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!-- Password: &amp;quot;koala&amp;quot; for both --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:user name=&amp;quot;user&amp;quot;
         password=&amp;quot;4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde&amp;quot;
         authorities=&amp;quot;user&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;security:user name=&amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;
         password=&amp;quot;4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde&amp;quot;
         authorities=&amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/security:user-service&amp;gt;
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The StandardPasswordEncoder is a small and quite nicely designed class that bundles everything you want a password encoder to do into a very small interface.  It uses an SHA-256 hasing together with an eight byte random salt to generate a password hash that is unique each time.  Although the starter application does not show this, for additional security you can add an extra secret value for your application, in which case the hash will be based on the password, the random salt, and the secret value.  This is configured using basic constructor injection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;encoder&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;constructor-arg value=&amp;quot;x9ajDR$#Qkr91&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the application configuration, we see that the application is configured with two users, &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;, both with the password &amp;quot;koala&amp;quot;, which is hashed to: 4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show you a little more about how the StandardPasswordController works, I&amp;#39;ve added a unit test to the code that IntelliJ Idea provides.  As you can guess from the code, each time the tests are run the output for each encoded string will be different, even though we are encoding the same password over and over again.  Moreover, though we can verify the encoded string against the password, the password is virtually impossible to reverse engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder;

public class StandardPasswordEncoderDemo {
    @Test
    public void testCannotReproduceHashFromConfigFile() {
        StandardPasswordEncoder encoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
        String password = &amp;quot;koala&amp;quot;;
        String encoded = encoder.encode(password);
        String encodedFromXML = &amp;quot;4efe081594ce25ee4efd9f7067f7f678a347bccf2de201f3adf2a3eb544850b465b4e51cdc3fcdde&amp;quot;;

        // What we generated is not what&amp;#39;s in the XML
        assertTrue(encodedFromXML != encoded);

        // But both what&amp;#39;s in the XML and what we generated match the password.
        assertTrue(encoder.matches(password, encoded));
        assertTrue(encoder.matches(password, encodedFromXML));

        System.out.println(encoded);
   }

    @Test
    public void testAnotherRunWillAlsoYieldDifferentHashes() {
        StandardPasswordEncoder encoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
        String password = &amp;quot;koala&amp;quot;;
        String encoded = encoder.encode(password);
        String encoded2 = encoder.encode(password);
        assertTrue(encoded2 != encoded);

        System.out.println(encoded);
        System.out.println(encoded2);
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using Security in the View Layer - The Spring Security Tag Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look in ApplicationController.java, we find the following method mapping:
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;@RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String index(ModelMap map) {
        // Additional code...
        return &amp;quot;index&amp;quot;;
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No surprises here, the root mapping is to the traditional index page.  Examining the source in src/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/index.jsp we find a good demonstration of the use of the Spring Security Tag Library.  First, we import the tag library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;%@ taglib prefix=&amp;quot;sec&amp;quot; uri=&amp;quot;http://www.springframework.org/security/tags&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have access to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/el-access.html#el-access-web&quot;&gt;Spring Security Expressions&lt;/a&gt; that we saw enabled earlier when we discussed the configuration. For example, we first check to see if the User has logged in or not, and if not, we prompt for a sign-in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;sec:authorize access=&amp;quot;isAnonymous()&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/spring_security_login&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sign In&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sec:authorize&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the inverse of the isAnonymousCheck, if the user is authenticated we display a welcome message and a sign-out link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;sec:authorize access=&amp;quot;isAuthenticated()&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello, ${userDetails.username}! &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/j_spring_security_logout&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sign Out&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sec:authorize&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for production use, there&amp;#39;s a bit of a bug in this code, since there&amp;#39;s a the user could be a user who asked to be remembered (&amp;quot;Remember Me&amp;quot;), in which case isAuthenticated would still return true even if the user were not logged in.  To eliminate this possibility, use &amp;quot;isFullyAuthenticated&amp;quot; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we do a check for the admin role and conditionally display a link if the signed in user has that role assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-http&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;sec:authorize access=&amp;quot;hasRole(&amp;#39;admin&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/admin&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Admin page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/sec:authorize&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, we&amp;#39;ve seen a basic Spring Security starter project that illustrates how to set up a very basic authentication based on pre-configured user names and passwords.  In Spring Security Part II, we&amp;#39;ll dig into how to handle the much more common use case of storing user authentication information in a database.  We&amp;#39;ll also dig into customizing the log-in forms.  This will serve as a starting point for a much more full featured authorization system suitable for a business to consumer or business to business web site.  Later on in another tutorial we&amp;#39;re planning to tie this database-based authentication system with Spring OAuth, allowing users with (for example) a Google account to sign in using that account.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Configuring Spring for Test versus Production</title>
				<description>&lt;h3&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Configuration Options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The META-INF Gospel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuring Spring Properties at Build Time Using Multiple Modules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuring Spring Properties at Run Time Using the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up  PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer in the ApplicationContext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Properties Files to Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injecting Properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing with JUnit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spring Configuration Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spring Framework is not opinionated software.  Instead, Spring has a rich set of configuration options about which you can -- indeed, about which you must -- make up your own mind.  In this tutorial we&amp;#39;ll discuss some of the ways you can easily configure your application to be ready for production, while still making it easy to work with your code in a test environment.
&lt;a href=&quot;META-INF&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The META-INF Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re first getting something working, the easiest path I&amp;#39;ve found is to locate your properties somewhere underneath what in the standard Maven directory structure is the src\main\resources\META-INF directory.  Then, to give just one example for now, you want to point to those resources as shown in the following annotation from a Unit test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;classpath:META-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml&amp;quot;)
// class YourTestClass { ...
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will work just fine, and although I&amp;#39;ve seen a few spec Nazis on Stackoverflow complain that the Java JAR specification contains the gospel truth about what files are allowed in the META-INF directory, I&amp;#39;ll take the side of Roo and other Spring tools to preach a new gospel to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally speaking, put your configuration files in META-INF, unless you like pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will get your software working, but the limitation of this approach is that once you&amp;#39;ve located all your configuration files in META-INF&amp;lt;somewhere&amp;gt; to set up a single environment correctly, how do you set up &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; environments like those you&amp;#39;ll need for test, staging, and production.  Though I&amp;#39;m sure there are a lot more ways to skin this poor cat, let&amp;#39;s discuss two of the more popular approaches to this problem.  The first option, which we&amp;#39;ll discuss more briefly, is to resolve all your option file dependencies at compile time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Spring Properties Using Multiple Modules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this approach, you set up a multi-module project.  This approach takes advantage of the fact that WAR files can pack all the jars they need inside themselves, ready to be deployed to Tomcat or another web server.  So we bundle  our code and any configuration files that are common to all our target environments in the WAR file, then build a jar file for each different environment containing only environment-specific files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we might end up with is a directory structure that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;root        
root/app
root/config_test
root/config_production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app directory contains the whole structure of the application&amp;#39;s WAR file project.  In the root directory is a pom file that builds the targets in the other directories, as shown in the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;XML&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;app
   config&lt;em&gt;test
   config&lt;/em&gt;production&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The config&lt;em&gt;test and config&lt;/em&gt;production files contain a src\main\resource\WEB-INF directory, whatever configuration files you need, and a pom file in the root to bundle the configuration files into a JAR.  What&amp;#39;s important is that although the contents of the files will contain different settings, the names of the files should be the same in each configuration file we build -- that way when they&amp;#39;re referenced from the main files in the application&amp;#39;s WAR files, all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, the WAR file in the main app depend on either the test configuration or the production configuration as desired, as shown in the snippet below.   In the snippet below, we&amp;#39;re building for the test environment, so the production configuration is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;XML&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;com.codesolid
config_test
1.0-SNAPSHOT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used the multi-module approach and it works fine, but having to build three projects to configure one WAR file is a bit heavy handed.  It also spreads the configuration files around more than I like.  Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s an easier way to get this done, and that is to resolve the configuration files at run time, not at build time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Spring Properties at Run Time Using the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One powerful mechanism that Spring provides to make configuration flexible across different environments is the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.  Since I think it&amp;#39;s the better approach, let&amp;#39;s take a look at a more detailed tutorial.  The code for this is available under the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer directory of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials&quot;&gt;Github Tutorials Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of our PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer build is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a single bean under test (yes, you guessed it: TestBean), and our mission, if we choose to accept it, is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamically set up properties in our configuration files, so we can switch to new properties in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inject the values of those properties into the test bean.  In many cases our properties would be consumed by another third-party bean, but injecting properties directly allows us to take the next step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a unit test to show that we correctly injected the properties we want for the appropriate environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Setting up  PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer in the ApplicationContext&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main &amp;quot;common configuration&amp;quot; area is in the META-INF\spring.  Our global properties file and main application context file go here.   Let&amp;#39;s look at applicationContext.xml, where the detailed comment explains what&amp;#39;s going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;XML&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;            classpath:META-INF/spring/*.properties
            classpath:META-INF/${environment}/*.properties
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Some Properties Files to Test&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have something to test, we&amp;#39;ve set up three simple properties files.  First, we have a global &amp;quot;common.properties&amp;quot; with our humble title: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
application.name=The Greatest Sample Ever
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next come two db.properties files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;test/db.properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;These are the values we&amp;#39;ll use when testing.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;database.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb
database.username=myuser
database.password=mypassword
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;production/db.properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Different values for the production server&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;database.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/proddb
database.username=prod_user
database.password=DoubleSecretProbation
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Injecting Properties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, lets inject only two of these properties.  If our setup is correct and we set the environment variable &amp;quot;environment&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; we should be able to verify that we get the right application name (a global property), and the test environment value for (for example) database.username. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We inject these properties in TestBean.java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
package com.codesolid.properties;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Service(value=&amp;quot;testBean&amp;quot;)
public class TestBean {
    private String applicationName;
    private String databaseUser;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;// This property is set in common.properties and will be the same
// for all environments, test, production, etc.
@Value(&amp;quot;${application.name}&amp;quot;)
public void setApplicationName(String applicationName) {
    this.applicationName = applicationName;
}

// In contrast, this property and other database related properties
// are quite likely different in test and production.
@Value(&amp;quot;${database.username}&amp;quot;)
public void setDatabaseUser(String databaseUser) {
    this.databaseUser = databaseUser;
}

public String getDatabaseUser() {
    return databaseUser;
}

public String getApplicationName() {
    return applicationName;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Testing with JUnit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final step, let&amp;#39;s make sure we&amp;#39;re running our test environment and our properties are injected correctly.  Our JUnit test is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
package com.codesolid.properties.tests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import com.codesolid.properties.TestBean;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;classpath:META-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml&amp;quot;)
public class ContextTests {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@SuppressWarnings(&amp;quot;SpringJavaAutowiringInspection&amp;quot;)
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext ac;

/* Verify that we&amp;#39;ve correctly injected a property from the Spring directory 
(in this case, the common.properties file).  Property files in this
directory define properties that can be used in all environments. */
@Test
public void testApplicationName() {
    String expected = &amp;quot;The Greatest Sample Ever&amp;quot;;
    TestBean test = (TestBean) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;testBean&amp;quot;);
    String actual = test.getApplicationName();
    assertEquals(actual, expected);
}

/* Verify that we&amp;#39;ve correctly injected a property from the test directory&amp;#39;s 
db.properties. Property files in the test directory only apply to the test 
environment and can be overridden in the production directory (for example). */
@Test
public void testDatabaseConfiguredCorrectly() {
    String expected = &amp;quot;myuser&amp;quot;;
    TestBean test = (TestBean) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;testBean&amp;quot;);
    String actual = test.getDatabaseUser();
    assertEquals(actual, expected);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer class lets you easily configure your WAR file for production, test, and any other environments you need -- and with that out of the way, you can now get busy writing your application.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Simple Hibernate, MySQL, and JUnit Tutorial</title>
				<description>&lt;h3&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting Started with Hibernate and MySQL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuring MySQL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuring Hibernate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimizing Setup Time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Simple Hibernate Entity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Hibernate Generic Entity Storage Class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JUnit Test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started With Hibernate and MySQL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we&amp;#39;re once again going to use JUnit as a learning tool for exploring various Java technologies -- in this case Hibernate.  We&amp;#39;ll be configuring Hibernate to run with MySQL in a way that works both in a standalone application or in a Spring or other web application.  Along the way we&amp;#39;ll also be setting up Log4J logging for hibernate.  We&amp;#39;ll work on a small generics class that -- although it doesn&amp;#39;t really do much more than wrap a few Hibernate functions -- will allow us to demonstrate and test out the basic CRUD operations -- Create, Read, Update, and Delete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, you can download the complete project files for IntelliJ Idea from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials&quot;&gt;Tutorials Repository on Github&lt;/a&gt;. This tutorial is located in the HibernateGeneric directory.  If you&amp;#39;re using Eclipse, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2013/05/17/how-to-run-the-codesolid-tutorials-in-eclipse/&quot;&gt;Eclipse instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring MySQL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial assumes you have mysql installed and can log in as root.  If you don&amp;#39;t have MySQL on your system, you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/windows-installation.html&quot;&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; and work through the instructions appropriate to your environment.  Go into the mysql monitor (i.e., the mysql command line client).  To do this, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;PathToMySQLBin&gt;\mysql.exe --user=root --password=YourRootPassword&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you haven&amp;#39;t set a mysql root password, you should -- if you haven&amp;#39;t, you can simply use the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;PathToMySQLBin&gt;\mysql.exe --user=root&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re connected in the mysql client, use the source command to run the dbsetup.sql script located in the database directory of the tutorial, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source database\dbsetup.sql&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;SQL&amp;quot;]
CREATE DATABASE tutorials;
USE tutorials;
GRANT ALL ON tutorials.* to &amp;#39;myuser&amp;#39;@&amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39; identified by &amp;#39;mypassword&amp;#39;;
commit;
flush privileges;
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the user name and password given in this script are pretty brain-dead and certainly not secure so probably want to change them.  If you do, that&amp;#39;s fine, you&amp;#39;ll just need to make one other change, in the hibernate configuration file.  Let&amp;#39;s look at that next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Hibernate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hibernate configuration file is the file hibernate.cfg.xml in the root of the resources directory (i.e., at src/main/resources).  As you can see, we&amp;#39;ve configured the JDBC driver directly in this file.  If you changed the user name or password in the dbsetup.sql script, you need to make the corresponding chagnes to the &amp;quot;connection.username&amp;quot; and / or &amp;quot;connection.password&amp;quot; properties below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also experiment with setting the show&lt;em&gt;sql and use&lt;/em&gt;sql_comments to true, especially if you run into problems.  For now they are turned off to keep the test run output a little bit cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;SQL&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;    com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    jdbc:mysql://localhost/tutorials
    myuser
    mypassword


    1


    org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect


    thread


    org.hibernate.cache.NoCacheProvider


    false
    false


    update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]
I won&amp;#39;t post the log4j configuration here.  Hibernate issues a warning if logging is not enabled, so I have configured Hibernate to use the log file, &amp;quot;log4j.log&amp;quot; in the root of the project directory.  The configuration file for log4j is at src/main/resources/log4j.xml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Minimizing Setup Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any process that initially connects to a database, initializing Hibernate sessions takes a fair amount of time, and is not something you want to be doing over and over again in your tests.  In the case of Hibernate, creating the SessionFactory object takes even more time, adding up to about 1.4 seconds on a laptop, or about .8 seconds on a faster machine.  We don&amp;#39;t want to be running that for every test class.  (To be sure, in the kind of one-class suite we&amp;#39;re running in this tutorial, it wouldn&amp;#39;t make a difference, but one of the purposes of these tutorials is to give you steal-able code that you can use in larger projects.  What we want is to initialize the SessionFactory only once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en-US/html/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;Hibernate tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that comes with the Hibernate docs gives us a part of the solution, the HibernateUtil class, which exists for the sole purpose of ensuring a one time initialization of a SessionFactory, which it then caches as a static object.  I&amp;#39;ve used this class pretty much verbatim in the current tutorial, changing only the package name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
// This file is adapted with only minor changes from the original in the hibernate
// tutorial, http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en-US/html/tutorial.html.
package com.codesolid.tutorials.model.dal;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class HibernateUtil {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory = buildSessionFactory();

private static SessionFactory buildSessionFactory() {
    try {
        // Create the SessionFactory from hibernate.cfg.xml
        return new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
    }
    catch (Throwable ex) {
        // Make sure you log the exception, as it might be swallowed
        System.err.println(&amp;quot;Initial SessionFactory creation failed.&amp;quot; + ex);
        throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(ex);
    }
}

public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
    return sessionFactory;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so we have a class where we can cache our SessionFactory, but the question remains -- how should we wire that up to our JUnit tests?  Since JUnit 4.9, we can use the @ClassRule annotation to set up a test suite with before and after methods that will run before and after all the classes in the suite have run.  This allows for the initialization of expensive resoures once before all the tests in the suite are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following listing shows the RuleSuite test suite, which builds with the rest of the tests in the src\test\java\code\codesolid\tests directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
package com.codesolid.tests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import com.codesolid.tutorials.model.dal.HibernateUtil;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.xml.Log4jEntityResolver;
import org.junit.ClassRule;
import org.junit.rules.ExternalResource;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Suite;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@RunWith( Suite.class )
@Suite.SuiteClasses( {
        TestStorage.class
        /* , Add more test classes here separated by commas*/
} )
public class RuleSuite{&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;static HibernateUtil util;

// This is a static field.  Per the ClassRule documentation,
// to use a ClassRule we need a field that is &amp;quot;public, static,
// and a subtype of of TestRule.&amp;quot;
// See http://junit.czweb.org/apidocs/org/junit/ClassRule.html
@ClassRule
public static ExternalResource testRule = new ExternalResource(){
    @Override
    protected void before() throws Throwable{
        Logger.getLogger(&amp;quot;com.codesolid.tests&amp;quot;).log(Level.DEBUG, &amp;quot;Inside RuleSuite::ExternalResource::before.&amp;quot;);
        util = new HibernateUtil();
    };

    @Override
    protected void after(){
        // Nothing to do here in this case.
        Logger.getLogger(&amp;quot;com.codesolid.tests&amp;quot;).log(Level.DEBUG, &amp;quot;Inside RuleSuite::ExternalResource::after.&amp;quot;);
    };
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve added some logging methods so you can see that the before and after methods are run only once at the start and end of the suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Simple Hibernate Entity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have an entity to save, I created an &amp;quot;Actor&amp;quot; entity.  This represents a user in the system, but I&amp;#39;ve named the class &amp;quot;Actor&amp;quot; to avoid any potential conflict with the SQL keyword by the same name.  I am using Hibernate annotations to define the entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Table allows us to name the table.
@Entity marks the class as representing a Hibernate Entity, that is to say, an object that Hibernate can save to and load from the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Id primary key field, we use the following Hibernate annotations to mark the field as the primary key and to auto-increment the field for each new record:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Id
@GeneratedValue(generator=&amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;)
@GenericGenerator(name=&amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;, strategy = &amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we used the column annotation to explicitly set the field name for the Role property to &amp;quot;user_role&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Column(name=&amp;quot;user_role&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
/**
 * Class Actor
 * Description:  A user of the system, the subject of a user story.  We use
 *               actor instead of user as table name to avoid any conflict
 *               with the database concept of user
 &lt;em&gt;/
package com.codesolid.tutorials.model.entities;
import org.hibernate.annotations.GenericGenerator;
import javax.persistence.&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Table( name = &amp;quot;ACTORS&amp;quot; )
@Entity
public class Actor {
    public static final String DEFAULT_ROLE = &amp;quot;Standard User&amp;quot;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;public Actor() {
    setRole(Actor.DEFAULT_ROLE);
}

private Long id;
private String role;

@Id
@GeneratedValue(generator=&amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;)
@GenericGenerator(name=&amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;, strategy = &amp;quot;increment&amp;quot;)
public Long getId() {
    return id;
}

public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
}


@Column(name=&amp;quot;user_role&amp;quot;)
public String getRole() {
    return role;
}

public void setRole(String role) {
    this.role = role;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step to making the Entity work is one that&amp;#39;s easy to forget, but as we saw when we discussed the hibernate.cfg.xml file, make sure you include a mapping to the entity class, as we show again below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;XML&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Hibernate Generic Entity Storage Class&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working with Hibernate enitities,  it struck me that many of the basic operations one might do with an entity could be captured well in a generic class, which is what we&amp;#39;ll be using to test here. As you can see below, each of the methods was pretty much a wrapper around a single Hibernate session call -- with the exception of BeginTransaction, which combines getting the session from the session factory and starting the transaction.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
package com.codesolid.tutorials.model.dal;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class Storage  {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
    return HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory();
}

private T entity;
private Session session;

public void beginTransaction() {
    session = Storage.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
    session.beginTransaction();
}

public void commit () {
    session.getTransaction().commit();
}

public Storage(T entity) {
    this.entity = entity;
}

public void update(T entity) {
    session.update(entity);
}

public Long insert(T entity) {
    return (Long) session.save(entity);
}

public void delete(T entity) {
    session.delete(entity);
}

// This call will issue a warning about the unchecked cast,
// but we know the value returned will be of the right type because
// we specify the entity (T) class in the call.
//
// Note that &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; will return a null if no value with this id fails
@SuppressWarnings (value=&amp;quot;unchecked&amp;quot;)
public T getById(Long id) {
    return (T) session.get(entity.getClass(), id);        
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]
Taken together, this class and the unit tests I wrote for it were a good way to discover a couple of interesting Hibernate gotchas.  The first Hibernate mine that I steped on was that objects are no longer usable outside the context of a transaction.  Before my testing uncovered this, my original implementation of getById was called loadById, and the implementation and test looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
  // Implementation&lt;br&gt;
    public T getById(Long id) {
        storage.beginTransaction();
        T obj = (T) session.load(entity.getClass(), id);
        session.getTransaction().commit();
        return obj;
    }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Test code:
   // ...
   Actor actor  = storage.getById(id);
   assertEquals(actor.getRole(), &amp;quot;Some Role&amp;quot;);
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed like a safe approach (albeit not an efficient one since each call is wrapped in a transaction).  As it turns out, because Hibernate uses lazy initialization, the object returned from getById needed to still have the transaction active.  As a result, I got the following exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused me to push the transaction management out to the client, so I exposed beginTransaction and commit methods on my storage class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, the code and test looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
// Implmentation
public T getById(Long id) {
    return (T) session.load(entity.getClass(), id);
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Test code
storage.beginTransaction();
Actor actor  = storage.getById(id);
assertEquals(actor.getRole(), &amp;quot;Some Role&amp;quot;);
storage.commit();
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second interesting Hibernate quirk that I ran into was in trying to test my delete method.  Originally I wrote the test by deleting an object and then checking for the ObjectNotFoundException when I called loadById in an effort to reload the deleted object.  The first time I ran it, that test passed, but a few minutes later it failed.  It turns out that loadById may or may not return an ObjectNotFoundException, or it may instead return a &amp;quot;proxy object&amp;quot;, though I admit I have a bit of a hard time following the architectural genius behind the decision to return a proxy to an object that doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet -- or in this case, doesn&amp;#39;t exist any more.  At that time I researched it and found that getById has the more reasonable behavior of reliably returning a for objects that don&amp;#39;t exist, so the test and the code evolved accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The JUnit Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the final form of the JUnit test is below.  Even though I&amp;#39;m showing it last, in reality the process was more test-first, going back and forth between the tests, the configuration, and the classes under development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
package com.codesolid.tests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import com.codesolid.tutorials.model.entities.&lt;em&gt;;
import com.codesolid.tutorials.model.dal.Storage;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class TestStorage {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@Test
public void testWrite() {
    // Just a write, verify id set
    Actor user = new Actor();
    Storage storage = new Storage(user);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    user.setRole(&amp;quot;SuperUser&amp;quot;);
    assertNull(user.getId());
    storage.insert(user);
    assertNotNull(user.getId());
    storage.commit();
}

@Test
public void testWriteAndRead() {

    // This time write and read back
    String overRideRole = &amp;quot;SuperUser&amp;quot;;

    // Write
    Actor actor = new Actor();
    Storage storage = new Storage(actor);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    actor.setRole(overRideRole);
    assertNull(actor.getId());
    storage.insert(actor);
    assertNotNull(actor.getId());
    Long id = actor.getId();
    storage.commit();

    // Read and verify
    Actor actor2  = new Actor();
    assertEquals(actor2.getRole(), Actor.DEFAULT_ROLE);
    storage = new Storage(actor2);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    actor2 = storage.getById(id);
    assertEquals(actor2.getRole(), overRideRole);
    storage.commit();
}


@Test
public void testUpdate() {

    String overRideRole = &amp;quot;SuperUser&amp;quot;;
    String newOverrideRole = &amp;quot;GUEST&amp;quot;;

    // Insert an actor
    Actor actor = new Actor();
    Storage storage = new Storage(actor);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    actor.setRole(overRideRole);
    assertNull(actor.getId());
    storage.insert(actor);
    assertNotNull(actor.getId());
    Long id = actor.getId();
    storage.commit();

    // Read it back
    Actor actor2  = new Actor();
    assertEquals(actor2.getRole(), Actor.DEFAULT_ROLE);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    actor2 = storage.getById(id);
    assertEquals(actor2.getRole(), overRideRole);

    // Update it
    actor2.setRole(newOverrideRole);
    storage.update(actor2);
    storage.commit();

    // Read it again and verify update
    storage.beginTransaction();
    Actor actor3  = storage.getById(id);
    assertEquals(actor3.getRole(), newOverrideRole);
    storage.commit();
}

@Test
public void testDelete() {

    Actor actor = new Actor();
    Storage storage = new Storage(actor);

    // Write
    storage.beginTransaction();
    storage.insert(actor);
    Long id = actor.getId();
    storage.commit();

    // Delete it now
    assert(actor.getId() &amp;gt; 0);
    storage.beginTransaction();
    storage.delete(actor);
    storage.commit();

    // Now we can&amp;#39;t read it back, as expected
    storage.beginTransaction();
    Actor actor2 = storage.getById(id);
    assertNull(actor2);
    storage.commit();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to Run the CodeSolid Tutorials in Eclipse</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve taken a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials&quot;&gt;Github Repository&lt;/a&gt; for the CodeSolid tutorials, you may have noticed that the project files all use IntelliJ Idea.  I use the Ultimate Edition (currently Version 12) for most of my development, but recently I promised to look into using these project files in Eclipse.  I had a feeling it would work since I have sourced the Maven project -- i.e., the POM files, those named pom.xml in the root of each tutorial -- but being the good test infected developer that I am, I try not to take &amp;quot;that should work&amp;quot; for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the good news in this case is that not only should it work, but it actually does.  I have tested it out on the Spring Tool Suite version 3.2, as well as on a more vanilla version of Eclipse (Indigo -- version 3.7).  Because we&amp;#39;re importing Maven files, Maven is resolving the dependencies -- meaning the Spring Tutorial works even without the Spring Tool Suite.  (How cool is that -- it&amp;#39;s magic!)  To run the projects, start by right clicking on any empty space in the Package Explorer window, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;EclipseImport&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the menu, select Import.  In the Import dialog box, you want to select Maven, then Existing Maven Project, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport2.png&quot; alt=&quot;EclipseImport2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you then navigate to the root of the tutorials directory, you can select which tutorials you want to import.  I&amp;#39;m writing this article when there are only two tutorials available -- you&amp;#39;ll likely see more projects available.  Select the project(s) you want, click finish, and you&amp;#39;re done!  You can now run the tutorials in Eclipse.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/EclipseImport3.png&quot; alt=&quot;EclipseImport3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Spring Unit Testing Using JUnit</title>
				<description>&lt;div id=&quot;table_of_contents&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul &gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Introduction&quot;&gt;The Simplest Case - Exploring the IDE Starter Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#TestingSpringBeans&quot;&gt;Testing Some Basic Spring Beans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ApplicationContext&quot;&gt;Pojo Style: Getting an Application Context in a junit.org Test Runner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;Exploring the IDE Starter Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we&amp;#39;ll set up some really basic Spring unit tests -- the sort of thing that is vanilla enough so you can steal it and get started on your own tests. I developed these tests in IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition, but when I check them in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codesolid/tutorials&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ll try to make something available in Maven and Eclipse, so you can try it out that way if you like. (Update -- that&amp;#39;s done, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2013/05/17/how-to-run-the-codesolid-tutorials-in-eclipse/&quot;&gt;here are the instructions&lt;/a&gt;).  I originally developed these tests in a web app I was working on, but to keep things simple let&amp;#39;s start instead by creating a new project in Idea as a &amp;quot;Spring Application&amp;quot; for the project type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SwingJUnitScreenshot1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SwingJUnitScreenshot1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring Starter Project in IntelliJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then make the project from the build menu, and you&amp;#39;ll see if you look around in the test directory (actually src\test\java\foo.bar, to be precise), that Idea has created your first Spring Test for you as SpringAppTests.java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package foo.bar;

import junit.framework.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;classpath:spring-config.xml&amp;quot;)
public class SpringAppTests {
@Autowired
private HelloService helloService;

@Test
public void testSayHello() {
Assert.assertEquals(&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;, helloService.sayHello());
}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unit test is doing a few interesting things. First of all, it&amp;#39;s annotated as &amp;quot;@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)&amp;quot;. The Spring JUnit runner, which works in conjunction with the Spring &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/test/context/TestContextManager.html&quot;&gt;TestContextManager&lt;/a&gt;, allows you to easily set up Spring ApplicationContexts for your tests, as you can see it does here with the annotation @ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;classpath:spring-config.xml&amp;quot;). Inside the SpringAppTests class, you can see that you can also use Dependency Injection to wire up your objects for you. Note that the object that&amp;#39;s under the @Autowired annotation is used in the test without an explicit constructor call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;TestingSpringBeans&quot; name=&quot;TestingSpringBeans&quot;&gt;Testing Some Basic Spring Beans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s write our own test to exercise some basic beans to see how the Spring framework injects dependencies as needed. We&amp;#39;ll want to compare that to what would happen outside of the framework so we&amp;#39;ll set up our beans in such a way as to work differently depending on the context -- Spring versus non-Spring. (I was tempted to say Spring versus Fall in that last sentence, but Java suffers from enough puns already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say we want to model some classes to capture software User Stories. Of course, every story needs a character, so we&amp;#39;ll want a class to model the person using the software. One very useful form of user story takes the basic form: As a &lt;Type of User&gt; I want to &lt;Something the software can do&gt; in order that &lt;some benefit to the user&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s write two beans to capture the relationship between a user and the UserStory. First, the UserStory class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;// UserStory.java

package com.codesolid.tutorials;

/**
* Class UserStory
* Description: An example bean that models a user story.
* Uses the standard story form:
* &amp;quot;As a ______&amp;quot; (user role), &amp;quot;I want to ______&amp;quot; (actionDesired)
* &amp;quot;so that _____&amp;quot; (outcomeDesired).
*/
public class UserStory {
private User user;
private String actionDesired = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;
private String outcomeDesired = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;
public UserStory() {
}

public User getUser() {
return user;
}

public void setUser(User user) {
this.user = user;
}

public String getActionDesired() {
return actionDesired;
}

public void setActionDesired(String actionDesired) {
this.actionDesired = actionDesired;
}

public String getOutcomeDesired() {
return outcomeDesired;
}

public void setOutcomeDesired(String outcomeDesired) {
this.outcomeDesired = outcomeDesired;
}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the User class:
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package com.codesolid.tutorials;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/**
* Class User
* Description: An example of a bean dependency. Story is dependent on Actor.
*/
public class User {
private String role;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public User() {
setRole(&amp;quot;User&amp;quot;);
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public String getRole() {
return role;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public void setRole(String role) {
this.role = role;
}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, if you were to construct a UserStory object at this point, the user field it contains would be null. The trade-off on class dependencies is basically this: You can ensure that your objects are always fully constructed by putting all the dependencies in the constructor. However, this means that your object becomes tightly coupled with other objects, and harder to test. Having accessors to set the dependencies means you have the flexibility to test only that part of the object that relies on the dependencies, or you can set up all your dependencies up front and test a fully constructed object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring can inject the dependencies either way, but many people prefer using the accessors using what&amp;#39;s known as &amp;quot;Setter Based Dependency Injection&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the file src\main\resources\spring-config.xml. Here we&amp;#39;ve configured the dependency using XML. (Spring also allows this to be done using annotations, but we won&amp;#39;t cover that in this tutorial):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we add our dependencies, the file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-XML&#39;&gt;xmlns:xsi=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&amp;quot;
xmlns:context=&amp;quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/context&amp;quot;
xsi:schemaLocation=&amp;quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd 
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context 
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re now ready to write some tests against this code. I&amp;#39;ll show you the whole listing in one go, since I&amp;#39;ve commented it fairly heavily to show what we&amp;#39;re demonstrating in each case. Bear with the imports -- there&amp;#39;s some code underneath, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package com.codesolid.tutorials.tests;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import com.codesolid.tutorials.UserStory;
import com.codesolid.tutorials.User;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.setup.MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(&amp;quot;file:src/main/resources/spring-config.xml&amp;quot;)
public class ContextTests {

@SuppressWarnings(&amp;quot;SpringJavaAutowiringInspection&amp;quot;)
@Autowired
protected ApplicationContext ac;

// Using ApplicationContext
// The getBean method is the workhorse of the Spring ApplicationContext.
// The user field in the UserStory object was set up (dependency injected)
// by Spring:
@Test
public void testUserNotNull() {
UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
assertNotNull(story.getUser());
}

// Not using ApplicationContext
// Regular non-Spring instantiation
// Instantiating our own UserStory, you can see that the user
// is null.
@Test
public void testUserStoryNotFromContext() {
UserStory story = new UserStory();
assertNull(story.getUser());
}

// Not using ApplicationContext
// Regular non-Spring instantiation
// The default role if you just call the constructor
// is &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;.
@Test
public void testNonSpringUserDefaultRole()
{
User u = new User();
assertEquals(u.getRole(), &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;);
}

// Using ApplicationContext
// Since Spring instantiated this according to the property
// from spring-config.xml, it overrode the default &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;
// role with &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;. (This presumably
// is Wile E. Coyote.)
@Test
public void testUserRoleIsAsExpected() {
UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
assertEquals(story.getUser().getRole(), &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;);
}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Spring allows for a great deal of flexibility in configuring the objects in the system. In a simple context like this one it may be hard to see the advantage of this, but in the context of a large application, having a configuration system like this in place means that the system is very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;ApplicationContext&quot; name=&quot;ApplicationContext&quot;&gt;Getting an Application Context in a junit.org Test Runner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll probably use the SpringJUnit4ClassRunner for most of your Spring testing, since it is derived from the &amp;quot;vanilla&amp;quot;, junit.orgJ Unit4ClassRunner. However it&amp;#39;s also possible to get an ApplicationContext outside of the context of the Spring test runner, and doing this in JUnit demonstrates how to achieve this programatically. The following sample shows some of the same tests we ran earlier set up in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-java&#39;&gt;package com.codesolid.tutorials.tests;
import com.codesolid.tutorials.UserStory;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

/* Here we run one of the same tests we run in ContextTests, but we separate it out here to demonstrate
* we can do it with a POJU (Plain Old JUnit :) test runner.
*/
public class JUnitContextTests {

ApplicationContext ac;

@Before
public void setUp()
{
ac = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(&amp;quot;file:src/main/resources/spring-config.xml&amp;quot;);
}

@Test
public void testUserCorrectFromPlainOldJUnitTest() {

UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
// Spring is working fine using this app context
assertEquals(story.getUser().getRole(), &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;);

// In this case our User is not wired up
UserStory story2 = new UserStory();
assertNull(story2.getUser());
}

@Test
public void testPrewiredUserCorrect() {
UserStory story = (UserStory) ac.getBean(&amp;quot;userStory&amp;quot;);
assertEquals(story.getUser().getRole(), &amp;quot;SuperGenius User&amp;quot;);
}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you ask anyone who works with me, I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of automated unit testing in general and Test Driven Development (TDD) in particular. Ever since I first tried it out on a project eleven years ago, I&amp;#39;ve been convinced that Test Driven Development is a huge improvement over the number one software development &amp;quot;methodology&amp;quot; in the U.S.: code and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if TDD is so cool, the last sentence begs a very important question: why is code and fix so popular? Should you be considering more unit testing for your next project, or will you do just fine without it? Are there legitimate reasons not to consider automated unit testing? How much testing is enough?  What are the pros and cons of Test Driven Development and automated unit testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a software manager, the number one benefit to consider for automated unit testing is reduced costs. This may seem paradoxical -- how can writing &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; code cost you &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is that unit tests let your developers find bugs earlier in the development process than they would otherwise.  As a result of this, empirical studies such as the one conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ese/nagappan_tdd.pdf&quot;&gt;Nagappan et al&lt;/a&gt;. at Microsoft and IBM have shown a drop in the defect density of between 40% and 90% for teams using test driven development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are especially valuable as a safety net when the code needs to be changed to either add new features or fix an existing bug, since the  sanity check for new changes. Since maintenance accounts for between 60 and 90% of the software life cycle, it&amp;#39;s hard to overstate how the time taken up front to create a decent set of unit tests can pay for itself over and over again over the lifetime of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big plus to automated unit testing is something that rarely gets much mention but is crucially important. Writing unit tests during development means you&amp;#39;ll always have a stub for exercising a given method in the debugger. Getting my start 20,000 years ago as I did as a C and C++ programmer -- there be pointers there! -- running your code through the debugger as you were writing it was something that All-Right-Thinking-Programmers(tm) had to do. As my friend, Jim Alisago, put it early on in my career, &amp;quot;You might as well start in the debugger because you&amp;#39;re going to end up there anyway.&amp;quot; I sometimes get the impression reading the literature that Unit Testing replaces debugging -- on the contrary, to me, it enables it and enhances it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing while writing also forces you to try to make your interfaces clean enough to be tested. It&amp;#39;s sometimes hard to see the advantage of this until you work on a body of code where it wasn&amp;#39;t done, and the only way to exercise and focus on a given piece of code is to run the whole system and set a break-point. Unit tested code therefore tends to be less tightly coupled than code that sprang fully formed from the clever mind of a cowboy developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are a fantastic learning tool for developers using new technologies. Whenever I encounter something obtuse in some bit of software documentation, I find myself reaching for a small set of unit tests. Unit tests let me quickly find where the skeletons are buried in a new framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines serve as documentation for existing code, showing developers new to the code how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is of course the up front cost of writing the unit tests.   I believe that in almost all cases this cost will be amortized over the life of the project.  However, if a quick and dirty prototype is needed in a hurry, this initial time cost may not be acceptable.  A caveat is in order here, however:  many a quick and dirty prototype has been rushed from developer conference to deliverable without stopping at go or collecting $200.  Today&amp;#39;s quick and dirty prototype is often tomorrow&amp;#39;s legacy albatross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of legacy code, it is far, far easier to introduce unit testing at the start of a coding effort than it is to add unit tests during the maintenance phase of a project.  It&amp;#39;s more difficult enough that Michael Feathers was able to write a wonderful book about it.  However, as the Chinese are alleged to say, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any good technique, unit testing can be carried to an extreme. My own experience has been that the biggest benefits come from a moderate effort, with the tests always exercising the code in the simplest way possible.  If you find yourself frequently re-factoring your tests, there&amp;#39;s a good chance you&amp;#39;re spending too much time on the test suite.  Similarly, there&amp;#39;s not much point to optimizing your tests with stubs and mocks if they don&amp;#39;t take that long to run yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests of course need to be maintained to be useful -- ideally keeping the error / failure rate at zero.  This of course means there are times when the tests themselves have to change to keep track of new changes to the code, but the whole point of the test suite is to bring the impact of your changes into sharp focus.  Breaking existing callers depending on an interface is not a big deal -- but doing it without knowing you did it is a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are just unit tests.  Although, as we mentioned above, they do have a role in documentation, unit tests are not a substitute for documentation. Contrary to what many agile texts would have you believe, not all comments are &amp;quot;smells&amp;quot;.  Similarly, the planning that takes place in the process of producing initial specifications almost always justifies a reasonable effort.  Nor are unit tests a substitute for integration testing, acceptance testing, or other automated / manual testing done by sharp quality engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>A Simple JUnit Tutorial using Maven and IntelliJ Idea</title>
				<description>&lt;h3&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is JUnit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set Up the Maven Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run In Maven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importing the Maven Project Into Idea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing Your First Test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building and Running the Tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing a Bug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is JUnit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JUnit is a powerful and easy to use tool that every Java programmer should know.  It&amp;#39;s a unit test framework  That is to say, it&amp;#39;s a framework for testing out small pieces of code, such as individual classes and methods, as the code is being developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those newcomers to Java who aren&amp;#39;t familiar with JUnit, Here is a really simple, &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; style tutorial about how to use JUnit with Maven and IntelliJ Idea Community Edition -- both free tools.  By the way, this tutorial also works fine with the professional edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get The Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to set up those tools, here are the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html&quot;&gt;IntelliJ Idea download page&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation&quot;&gt;Maven Download / Installation page&lt;/a&gt;.  Be sure to read the installation page carefully in the case of Maven especially&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set up the Maven Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it may seem counter-intuitive, I find that the easiest way to start with Maven and Idea projects is not to start in Idea, but to simply to save a maven project file (&amp;quot;pom.xml&amp;quot;) in a text editor.  Here is that file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;4.0.0

com.particlewave
HelloJUnit
1.0



        junit
        junit
        4.11
        test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Run In Maven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the file above using a plain text editor in a new directory that will be the root directory of you project, then open a command prompt at that location.  Enter the command  &amp;quot;mvn -q install&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re new to Maven, the cool thing about it is that it will install any dependencies your project needs, so if the universe is behaving as it should you should see output that looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[debug] execute contextualize
[debug] execute contextualize&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; T E S T S&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice no tests were run -- that&amp;#39;s as expected, since we haven&amp;#39;t written them yet!  Before we do, while still at the command line there&amp;#39;s one more manual step we have to do, and that&amp;#39;s to set up our directory structure in a way that Maven expects it.  On Windows the command is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
md src\main\java
md src\main\resources
md src\test\java
md src\test\resources
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Unix or a Mac the command would be:
[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
mkdir -p src/main/java
mkdir -p src/main/resources
mkdir -p src/test/java
mkdir -p src/test/resources
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Importing the Project Into Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you&amp;#39;re ready to open the Idea IDE.  Now we&amp;#39;re going to create an Idea project by importing the maven file we just created.  Click on Import Project, and then navigate to where you have that pom file stored.  It should look something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CaptureJUnit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first dialog that comes up, I usually like to check the box that says &amp;quot;Import Maven projects automatically&amp;quot;, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MavenImport.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll then click through a few more dialog boxes, selecting the default for each.  On the one that asks you to select a JVM, make sure it looks like a valid one is selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve imported the project, locate the project view on the left, and navigate to the src\test\java directory, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/JUnitProjectView.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your First Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right click on the src\test\java directory, and select New / File.  Give it the name &amp;quot;TestHello.java&amp;quot;, and paste the following code into it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;Java&amp;quot;]
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class TestHello {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@Test
public void testPasses() {
    String expected = &amp;quot;Hello, JUnit!&amp;quot;;
    String hello = &amp;quot;Hello, JUnit!&amp;quot;;
    assertEquals(hello, expected);
}

@Test
public void testFails() {
    // The worlds most obvious bug:
    assertTrue(false);
}

@Test
public void testArray() {
    int [] array1 = new int[] {1, 2, 3};
    int [] array2 = new int[] {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(array1, array2);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building and Running the Tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the test, from the Idea menu select &amp;quot;Build / Make Project&amp;quot;.  Next, from the Run menu select Debug.  If all goes well you should see a configuration named &amp;quot;Test Hello&amp;quot;.  Click that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fixing a Bug&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will next see the output of the tests in a window that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/JUnitDebug.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed when you pasted the code that the testFails method contains &amp;quot;The world&amp;#39;s most obvious bug&amp;quot;.  Because of this, that test will fail. You&amp;#39;ll notice that -- very conveniently -- there will be a link to TestHello.java:16 -- clicking that link will bring you right to the failing line of code, where you should be able to fix it easily. Running tests in the debugger like this is a very easy way to fix the failing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these tests are very simple and do not test any &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; code.  In a real project you&amp;#39;d be moving back between fixing the bugs in the code, which the test code was exercising, while writing new tests to exercise new code.  But if you put your Java classes in src\main\java, you can easily test them from tests you add to src\test\java.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What If Carpenters Were Hired Like Programmers?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If carpenters were hired like programmers, job ads might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help Wanted, Carpenter.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with Craftsman brand hammers and saws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five to ten years of experience building round tables out of mahogany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with the full carpentry life cycle including sawing, hammering, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to Have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience building tables for free (open source tables).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of square tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pine experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>And Then There Were Two</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Only a scant 3 1/2 years after I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2009/11/01/employee-owned-software-company/&quot;&gt;first started writing&lt;/a&gt; about ParticleWave as an employee owned software company, yesterday I finally met with someone with enough desperation good sense to become employee owner #2. This is really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus will be on Quality Assurance, especially test case automation using Selenium on Java and Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of exciting work ahead of us, putting our sales contacts together, setting up the testing lab, building a brand and digging into the tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re having another organizational meeting at 9:00 as a Google hangout. We&amp;#39;ll be meeting weekly. If you&amp;#39;re a developer / QA engineer or a client marketing focused staffing professional, we&amp;#39;d like to extend an invitation to attend a future meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a draft business plan for an employee owned software contracting business providing contracting, outsourcing, and staffing services focused on software development. Our initial focus will be on programming, and quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of being an employee owned business will be to ensure the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That to the largest extent possible, the profits earned by the company will be enjoyed by the contractor doing the work and the salesperson booking the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That all employees have a direct stake in the success of every contract and the success of the company. This is an important part of our business story.  The idea of peer review and how we implement on this needs to be further developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That to the largest extent possible, company decisions are made through a collective and democratic process, governed by a more extensive constitution that will be drafted and adopted at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposed Revenue Sharing Split&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For contract work, our (proposed) company split for each billable dollar will be:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60 cents toward direct employee compensation to the technical contractor doing the work (salary and benefits).
25 cents toward the salesperson / salespeople who were the procuring cause of the business. (A portion of this may also be paid to any contractors who may have helped bring in the business).
15 cents other -- (to be determined later by the employee owners) We expect that a substantial part of this will be recruitment bonuses for new hires and the remainder will be for company overhead. Alternatively, we may wish to fund performance bonuses either for outstanding technical achievement or increase the commission paid to full time salespeople.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Containment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will avoid offices for a long time, maybe forever. This is not to say that we’ll only pursue telecommute opportunities -- many contracts are on-site. I have worked for companies that did outsourcing and had everybody in a building and that may be a way to go in the future -- but we may be able to provide a better service if we combine on-site contractors with an effective system of remoting workers offsite (perhaps with tiered pricing for our customers). Company meetings by Skype, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hire employee number 2 etc. Further develop our attractiveness to our fellow potential employee owners. Think through what a great company would look like for some software developers, and make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further refine our presentation that we make to clients. What are the key advantages of working with us versus whatever other choices you might have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refine this plan further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start approaching recruiters to learn more about the sales / HR end of the business and identify possible partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about if we want to focus on certain specifics in terms of languages / technologies and / or capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Let the Development Department Run Your One Man Company</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days I revisited the code for my project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.relaysafe.com&quot;&gt;RelaySafe Secure Email&lt;/a&gt;, after taking some detours into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning MongoDB and working on the beginnings of a different site and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a Ruby on Rails User Group in Folsom, and within a week...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering if I&amp;#39;ll have the perseverance to continue with the Ruby on Rails User Group in Folsom and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registering for a CollabFinder account and fielding &amp;quot;job offers&amp;quot; from folks who apparently don&amp;#39;t understand that the word &amp;quot;job&amp;quot; implies some sort of remuneration, and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going off in another direction, in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way I also read an article by a developer who worked on an open source project I worked on.  The article was about being a developer and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tashian.com/carl/startup.html&quot;&gt;foundering in a start-up&lt;/a&gt;, and it sounded all too familiar to me.  I too know what it&amp;#39;s like to have one idea, work on it for awhile, hit a roadblock of some kind, and then instead of finding away around or through, ending up on a different road entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when developers are in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salesmen are Your Friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in sales for awhile.  I&amp;#39;m not sure I was ever really good at it, but it did give me a better understanding of  how sales people look at the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in sales I wrote some web sites to help me, which from a software perspective were complete hacks, yet which were successful from a sales perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales is a different world.  As Dan Akroyd&amp;#39;s character, Ray, said famously in Ghostbusters, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve worked in the private sector.  They expect results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I look at my silly pre-alpha app and wonder, &amp;quot;I wonder if this other thing over there would be more fun to work on?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a salesman, I know that &amp;quot;this thing over there&amp;quot; that might be more fun to work on is both less finished and more difficult than my original app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesman are those guys in your company who are always asking &amp;quot;when will it be ready?&amp;quot;, as though the development work were easy, and as though you really could predict the finish date with absolute accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to let me inner salesman run the company for a few weeks.  It won&amp;#39;t be much fun listening to that bozo, but the app will move forward, and it may become something I can sell.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Desarrollo en Ruby on Rails en Estados Unidos</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Quisiera volver a considerar el asunto que &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2009/11/01/employee-owned-software-company/&quot;&gt;consideré&lt;/a&gt; hace tres años, el tema de formar una empresa de desarrollo de software formado como &amp;quot;propiedad de los empleados&amp;quot;.  Pero esta vez, quiero considerarlo en un contexto internacional.  Hace tres años, no hablaba español -- hoy, si (mal, por lo menos, pero si).  Hace tres años, no estuve en una posición para aprovechar el deseo de algunos empleadores aquí -- externalización, o como se llama aquí, &amp;quot;outsourcing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actualmente, imagino una empressa en lo cual trabajamos juntos en una &amp;quot;bolsa de trabajos&amp;quot; (o tal vez, &amp;quot;bolsa para contratistas&amp;quot;).  Una idea seria que podriamos ganar un poquito por vender los anuncios inmediatamente, y podemos ofrecer nuestro servicio como contratistas a los empleadores tambien.  Otra idea seria que podriamos contratar un vendedor aqui quien podria ganar sus comisiones cuando nos consigua contratos.  Ademas (o alternativamente), podriamos desarrollar un producto de ¨tiempo y facturación¨ para contabilizar nuestras propias horas en los proyectos, y tambien podriamos ofrecerlo en inglés y español.   Si estamos interesados, podria donar mi otra aplicación, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.RelaySafe.com&quot;&gt;RelaySafe&lt;/a&gt;, que se puede terminar e igualmente ofrecer en inglés y español.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por cualquier medio, lo importante es que juntos disfrutamos los frutos de nuestro trabajo, y que juntos lleguemos a decidir nuestros destinos y tareas -- los dos sellos de calidad de una empresa propiedad de los empleados.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Translating Application.html.erb to Haml</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnlockwood.com/2012/11/07/learnapp/&quot;&gt;latest pet Rails&lt;/a&gt; project, I&amp;#39;m sharpening up my nascent HAML skills a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re thinking about learning HAML, let me assure you a little:  it&amp;#39;s not that hard.  Compared to programming generally, Rails in particular, HTML, and all the other stuff you learned before it occurred to you to learn HAML, HAML is pretty simple stuff.  The best way to learn it is to simply dive in as the tutorial suggests and translate a file or two from your current project.  That will teach you the basics.  When you&amp;#39;ve done a file or two, you&amp;#39;re ready to take on translating a layout such as application.html.erb to haml.  This is a bit more of a challenge -- but still not a big deal, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted a couple of code samples that show the before and after to Gist.  The before of course is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/4051866&quot;&gt;application.html.erb&lt;/a&gt;.  The translated file also has a couple of modifications, because as I was working on this I was also internationalizing the site, but that&amp;#39;s OK, it&amp;#39;s good for a challenge.  Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/4051775&quot;&gt;application.html.haml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the HAML, first we have a doctype declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
!!!
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will turn into an HTML5 doctype declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html&quot;&gt;HAML documetation&lt;/a&gt;, the head section of the layout is a sort of mini-haml lesson all by itself, so let&amp;#39;s take a look at that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
%head
  %title= content&lt;em&gt;for?(:title) ? yield(:title) : I18n.t(&amp;quot;site&lt;/em&gt;title&amp;quot;)
  %meta{:name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;, :content=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;#{ content&lt;em&gt;for?(:description) ? yield(:description) : (I18n.t &amp;quot;site&lt;/em&gt;description&amp;quot;)}&amp;quot;}
  %meta{:charset =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;}
  %meta{:author =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;John Lockwood&amp;quot;}{:cheese =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;limburger, :friends =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;moe larry&amp;quot;}&amp;#39;
  =stylesheet&lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt;tag    &amp;quot;application&amp;quot;, :media =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;
  =javascript&lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt;tag &amp;quot;application&amp;quot;
  =csrf&lt;em&gt;meta&lt;/em&gt;tags
  = yield(:head)
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head tag and the title tag show the basic HAML conventions of using %tagname for tags, and indentation for nesting one tag within another.  After title we have an equals sign, =, to interpret the rest of the line as ruby code.  We&amp;#39;re setting up a flexible content&lt;em&gt;for block so we can set the title on a per-page basis, and we&amp;#39;ve modified the original line to use an internationalized string:  I18n.t(&amp;quot;site&lt;/em&gt;title&amp;quot;).  Anyway, the main point here is that we can have whatever ruby expression we want after the = and it will be evaluated and output to the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get to the meta tags, things start to get a bit interesting.  To get HTML attributes, HAML uses a syntax that looks like Ruby hash attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the HAML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby]
%curly_request{:cheese =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;limburger, :friends =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;moe larry&amp;quot;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;renders in HTML as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;html]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good, but what if you need to build your HTML attributes using Ruby code?  Not to worry, HAML provides for Ruby interpolation using a syntax akin to string interpolation in Ruby.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
%meta{:name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;, :content=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;#{ content&lt;em&gt;for?(:description) ? yield(:description) : (I18n.t &amp;quot;site&lt;/em&gt;description&amp;quot;)}&amp;quot;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above, we&amp;#39;re creating a meta description tag, and our content attribute for this tag is the interpolated ruby expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
content&lt;em&gt;for?(:description) ? yield(:description) : (I18n.t &amp;quot;site&lt;/em&gt;description&amp;quot;)
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve made our description flexible, and we&amp;#39;ve internationalized our default site description, so your site can be Google optimized for English speakers as &amp;quot;The best site for learning about eating cheese&amp;quot;, while your Guatemalan visitors will see &amp;quot;El mejor sitio para aprender comer queso.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International haml and cheese!  How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tempted to leave it there on a tasty note, but let me just steer you clear of one little HAML gotcha to avoid.  Make sure when specifying attributes to not add any space before your attribute list.  The first whitespace it sees signals the content of the tag, so you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
%meta{:name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
%meta {:name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tag will evaluate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;]
{:name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;}
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely not what you want.  What will the Guatemalans think of you then?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thirty Point Five Reasons Why I Don&#39;t have a Rails Job.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There are at least twenty reasons I don&amp;#39;t have a Rails job. Actually there are 30.5 -- hindsight really is quite precise, isn&amp;#39;t it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m on my laptop keyboard, and I generally prefer something full sized without this silly track pad in the middle that ends up making my cursor jump around when I&amp;#39;m trying to publish something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally in an article like this you&amp;#39;d write an ordered list, but since I&amp;#39;m on a cheesy keyboard I&amp;#39;m going to make a virtue of necessity and quip that ordered lists are just a form of Powerpoint, and I&amp;#39;m going to write my reasons inline, like this:  (1) being too lazy, when on his laptop keyboard, to type a proper ordered list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working pretty hard on Rails in my off hours, on and off for some four or five years now.  Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll work on an open source project for a little while, thinking that maybe (2) my lack of &amp;quot;giving back to the Rails community&amp;quot; is the reason I don&amp;#39;t have a Rails job.  (I don&amp;#39;t know if Rails is a ghetto or not, but it is a strange bunch of people who judge professional success by how much working for free one can put up with).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, the last paragraph had reason (3), I cite the Rails is a Ghetto article, without even linking to it, which is pretty much a variation on reason 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so back to working hard.  When I&amp;#39;m not trying to demonstrate my professionalism by being an amateur, I&amp;#39;m often working a project that&amp;#39;s supposed to make me money someday, thinking it&amp;#39;s my lack of a Sass app in the channel.  (That was 3.5, and sorry for the fraction, but I found it while proofreading).  Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.relaysafe.com&quot;&gt;my latest unfinished Rails project&lt;/a&gt;, which at present boasts (4) a mere 132 specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to reason (5), dropping buzzwords like &amp;quot;specs&amp;quot; when recruiters think I should know something about unit testing instead, which brings me to my next points (6) relying on insider jokes to get me hired and (7) being implicitly disrespectful of recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m not working on either some open source project or a risky scheme, I&amp;#39;m spinning out of control learning new gems.  Wheeee!!!   I always yell Wheeee!!! when I&amp;#39;m spinning out of control learning new gems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so liberating (8) having a blog that nobody reads.  It really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so part of the thing is (9) I live in Sacramento (or close enough, but who the hell has heard of Orangevale?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some upshots of this are that (10) there&amp;#39;s a perception that whether Rails is a (technical) Ghetto or not, Sacramento certainly is.  Also, the only Rails shop in the local area is [redacted], and (11) those dummies didn&amp;#39;t hire me after (12) I made a mistake on a programming problem which (13) only had about twenty or so specs in it.  And now I&amp;#39;ve gone and publicly called someone who didn&amp;#39;t hire me dummies, demonstrating one or more of the following:  (14) I&amp;#39;m not a good salesman or (15) my feelings are too easily hurt and (16) I&amp;#39;m just a bitter and depressed weirdo, not a young and vibrant Mac owner.  But hey, I redacted them.  Serves them right.  And that&amp;#39;s the last time I&amp;#39;m dacting them, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I said it, you cheeky wonkers, (15) I don&amp;#39;t own a Mac.  I (16) program Rails on a Linux Mint box, which (17) some people don&amp;#39;t know is based on Ubuntu.  I even (18) use an IDE, which is why I have only 132 specs in my little unfinished project instead of the million and seventy-two it would need if I didn&amp;#39;t use an IDE.  That is to say, I use an IDE when I&amp;#39;m not using gvim, which of course is (19) not Textmate.  What&amp;#39;s worse, my IDE was written by the good folks at IntelliJ using Java, a language (20) which has semi-colons in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semi-colons!  Oh the humanity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of humanity, did I just call my readers &amp;quot;cheeky wonkers&amp;quot;?  Damn.  (21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s (22) my resume, which has lots of .NET and C# and Java and C++ and C and PHP and Perl and ASP and so forth on it, when you (23) recruiter types are looking for a &amp;quot;senior rails developer with 4-5 years experience&amp;quot;, meaning that either I have (24) too much experience or (25) too little, depending on how you want to reject me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, living in Sacramento (op cit.), people may also have the (26) mistaken idea that I won&amp;#39;t relocate if you throw a bunch of money at me, and that I&amp;#39;m just a cheeky wonker looking for a telecommute position, which granted would be nice, but not necessary.  Also, I can&amp;#39;t really show up at the local Rails user&amp;#39;s group, because 83.4% of the people there come from Streamsend, and I&amp;#39;ve already gone on record above as a bitter and lonely coot who (27) burns his bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably (28) too opinionated even for Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gems I&amp;#39;ve learned and used in the last week include HAML, YARD, and Mongo.  I probably should have mentioned them earlier.  Maybe I&amp;#39;m (29) not opinionated enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One or more of us has no sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry:  (30).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>In Praise of 100% Test Coverage, or How I Made My Code Smell Bad to Martin Fowler</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I am working on a Rails project that I have &amp;quot;in production&amp;quot; (barely), albeit in a state that&amp;#39;s not even pre-beta enough to announce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not an application yet, but it sports 97 specs and 100% test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line it had something like 80% coverage, and I decided it would be fun to see what it took to get it up to 100%. Along the way I thought I&amp;#39;d read about 100% coverage and what a good thing it was, only to find that most of the folks talking about it were doing the whole post-modern-er than thou number on it. You&amp;#39;ve seen these arguments. Take a perfectly good tool in the programmer&amp;#39;s arsenal, then talk about why it&amp;#39;s not a magic bullet, (in the absence of anyone making any kind of serious claim that it is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proably the smartest guy engaging in this sort of thing is Martin Fowler, who is way smarter than me, and certainly taken more seriously among the cool kids. Here is his &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html&quot;&gt;code coverage article&lt;/a&gt;. But you also have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/coverage.pdf&quot;&gt;Brian Marick&lt;/a&gt;, whom Folwer considers &amp;quot;very wise&amp;quot; for having said &amp;quot;I expect a high level of coverage. Sometimes managers require one. There&amp;#39;s a subtle difference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at some of the arguments that are proffered against code coverage, and see what we can make of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fowler writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you make a certain level of coverage a target, people will try to attain it. The trouble is that high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing. At the most absurd level you have AssertionFreeTesting. But even without that you get lots of tests looking for things that rarely go wrong distracting you from testing the things that really matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread that runs through both Marick&amp;#39;s argument and Fowler&amp;#39;s is that if you make high coverage numbers a requirement, people will find a way around it. Well, yes, I agree, but so what? People are always going to find a way to do the wrong thing, but here&amp;#39;s the problem: speeding laws aren&amp;#39;t bad just because people use radar detectors, and when a murderer finds a clever way to hide a body, we don&amp;#39;t take the law against murder off the book -- we try to improve our forensics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, does code coverage distract me from testing the things that really matter? Of course not. Code coverage is just one tool. Shortly after I had reached 100% coverage on this project, I pushed it into &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; (there are no customers for it yet) for the first time, and tried using it with someone else, since one of my other favorite tools for improving software quality is to get it off my desk as quickly as possible so we can work out the &amp;quot;works on my machine&amp;quot; bugs. Of course, as soon as I did that, I found a problem and had to go after it.  And of course, the fix wasn&amp;#39;t to improve how many times each line of my 100% covered code was hit -- the fix was to drive the coverage numbers down temporarily by writing more code and tests to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if I hadn&amp;#39;t focused on code coverage first, could I have found that problem on my own?  Well, I could have thought about better ways to test my code, and I still try to do that even though I&amp;#39;m shooting for 100% coverage. But in terms of this problem, I don&amp;#39;t think it would have turned it up.  The reason we have QA even though we have unit tests is that individual developers have blind spots, and testing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at another passage of Fowler&amp;#39;s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what is the value of coverage analysis again? Well it helps you find which bits of your code aren&amp;#39;t being tested. It&amp;#39;s worth running coverage tools every so often and looking at these bits of untested code. Do they worry you that they aren&amp;#39;t being tested?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__At this point he goes on to quote Marick again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it&amp;#39;s likely also weak in a way coverage can&amp;#39;t detect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, there are a number of problems with &amp;quot;running coverage tools every so often and looking at these bits of untested code&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, running the tools less often means I&amp;#39;m forced to think about testing every so often. Now if I&amp;#39;m doing the right thing, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be forced to think about it, I should be thinking about it all the time. But the truth is, as much as I love to test, testing is hard, and it consumes time.  That being the case, tools that keep me motivated to do it are my friends.  Test coverage is one such tool.  Yes, the &amp;quot;atta boy&amp;quot; it gives me is not any kind of real assurance that I&amp;#39;ve done my job well, but it helps to have it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, running the tools every so often means I have a LOT more code to look at when I do run them. When I was working on the bug above, my coverage got down to about 96%.  That&amp;#39;s actually a lot more of a drop than I expect to see when I&amp;#39;m further into the project and there&amp;#39;s a lot more code. But the real point is, after I&amp;#39;d done the tests I could think to do and gotten them passing, and done some manual testing as well, going after that 4% didn&amp;#39;t really take a lot of time. Moreover, that 4% all had to do with code that was fresh in my mind, which is a lot easier to write real tests for than something I look at &amp;quot;every so often&amp;quot;.  Getting up to 100% coverage was a chore when I first did it, and my project is brand new.  Doing it on an existing project would be that much harder, to be sure, and that&amp;#39;s the point.  I&amp;#39;d much rather invest a half hour here and there to keep the tests at 100% writing tests on fresh code than puzzling through uncovered code to try to find the naughty bits.  It&amp;#39;s just easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, keeping the code 100% covered means I always know exactly where to go to find the parts that aren&amp;#39;t -- they&amp;#39;re the parts I just worked on.  Yes, the tool tells where the uncovered parts are, but I&amp;#39;d rather not wade through all the noise that would be generated by all the other code that isn&amp;#39;t covered, trying to see what I missed in my tests of what I just wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I work in a shop where most of our code is legacy C and C++.  One of the best practices if you have a compiler that does type checking is to have zero warnings -- which is trivial to do if you&amp;#39;re on a team that does it, because if you see any warnings you know you just put them there and you can fix them before you check in the code.   On one of the projects I worked on, in contrast, the team has let things go to the point where there were well over 1000 warnings the last time I counted, and that was years ago.   Of course, most of these warnings are trivial, but there are bound to be some real bugs in over 1000 of them.  Do you have any idea where?  Nope.  Does anyone else on the team?  Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, given the number of lines in the code, I could say that a certain number of warnings is acceptable -- certainly we have well, well over 90% of our code that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; have a warning in it. Fowler says a level of test coverage of 80-90% is good enough, and writes that he &amp;quot;would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy, but not thinking about what they are doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that approach is that the same team that has the 1,000 warnings also has zero developer-run unit tests, tons of run time ASSERTS in debug mode -- you name it.  And surprise surprise, we spend an enormous amount of time chasing down issues that are embarrassing for a product that has been in production as long as ours has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe I&amp;#39;m not thinking about what I&amp;#39;m doing when I push for 100% coverage.  Maybe.  But on the team with the ASSERTs and the warnings and the no-unit tests and all the rest -- I KNOW we&amp;#39;re not thinking about what we&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No broken windows means just that -- NO broken windows.The problem with letting things be &amp;quot;just good enough&amp;quot; is that once your quality standards are just good enough, wait a few years and you&amp;#39;ll inevitably get to &amp;quot;please, somebody kill me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to Get In the Zone (A Reminder to myself in Case I Someday Read Me)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What matters to me most about software is that it lets me get in the zone, or a state of flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, software is how I make a living, but making a living at software, I very often report to a boss or other stakeholder whose pointy hair prevents me from getting into a state of flow, so by two in the afternoon I&amp;#39;m tired and forcing myself to just plod along at the now inimical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when I&amp;#39;m in a state of flow on a project, I could go for hours, except for occasional lonely moments like this when I feel I need to explain something to somebody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be great to have a job where I could spend more time in the zone, which I find myself getting into quite often on my current Rails side-project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could tell you the zone is about RSpec and Intellj with the Rails plugin and simplecov on a particular machine with Linux Mint installed and the right keyboard -- but of course, those are just temporary implementation details. I&amp;#39;ve been in the zone on the same keyboard under Windows 7 and Visual Studio and NUnit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it&amp;#39;s really about is being alone with a good unit test suite on a good keyboard, making progress on a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambition kills it, plodding along strengthens it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole elephant sometimes kills it, unless you can quickly grab the tail or the trunk or the leg to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers help. How many specs did I do? What does the coverage report say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that at some point enough specs and enough coverage with a little bit of code each day will turn into a product helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not be a great product, and it may not sell, but spending too much time on that sort of thinking is a surefire route out of the zone and onto working on someone else&amp;#39;s idea of a product, which is just a downward spiral. Someone else&amp;#39;s product is fine if you&amp;#39;re doing it when your fresh at 11:00 AM on a Tuesday and collecting a paycheck for it. But if you&amp;#39;re going to burn weekend after weekend away from your bicycle, doing it on someone else&amp;#39;s Rube Goldberg device, well, all that ever gets you is tired and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take a job without counting the unit tests first, unless they let you write it from scratch (in which case, count the money first) :).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on the tail, or the trunk, or the leg.  Your zone poem for the day:  &amp;quot;The elephant is irrelevant&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not getting paid for it, it&amp;#39;s your code, period.  If you need a friend, go to the pound and pet a puppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get back to work, or go outside and ride your bicycle.  Explaining things should be done in moderation.  Ain&amp;#39;t nobody reading you anyway.  See the line with the puppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Using FactoryGirl with the Rails Console</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I started doing some development work on the Rais blogging engine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fdv.github.com/typo&quot;&gt;Typo&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to use some of the helper methods I found in their factories within a test console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I had to go through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc]rails c test[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside the console:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
Factory.load(&amp;#39;spec/factories.rb&amp;#39;)
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can use your helper methods or load factories as you normally would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Use a helper method (if you have some)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my&lt;em&gt;object = my&lt;/em&gt;helper_method()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Load a factory normally&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user = FactoryGirl.create(:user)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly if this were harder I would have gotten a longer article out of it, but you have to take the good with the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting Started With Typo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Why do Rails developers like me blog on WordPress, which is written in PHP, instead of Typo, which is written in Ruby on Rails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple, really, maybe even obvious:  WordPress works better.  Wordpress has been in development longer, and it has more of everything, more plugins, more polish, more templates.  As of today, for example, Wordpress has some 20,244 plugins, while Typo has about 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit of a landslide, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to take a look at Typo is that it fits in with my professional development goals, which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work on some passive income Rails projects to improve my skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work on some open source projects to further develop my skills and give something back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To share my experiences here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the inevitable result, to land some paid Rails work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, being early in development, Typo&amp;#39;s not right (yet) for the casual blogger.  But at the same time, it&amp;#39;s an ideal project on which a Rails developer can hope to make important contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Typo Up and Running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://fdv.github.com/typo/&quot;&gt;Typo blog&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we&amp;#39;re supposed to start with something more or less like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc]
$ gem install typo
$ typo install some/path
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out the first line, we get a clue as to the sort of development fun we can have with this product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re greeted with the following in nice red letters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;[cc]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 6.0, Typo is no longer available as a gem. 
Please download Typo source at http://typosphere.org/stable.tgz &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Typo from scratch: https://github.com/fdv/typo/wiki/Installing-Typo
Upgrading Typo from an older version: https://github.com/fdv/typo/wiki/Upgrading-to-typo-6.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you get that message, the gem that&amp;#39;s no longer available will be installed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s OK, let&amp;#39;s not let it deter us from doing the right thing according to the warning.  Getting the stable release specified in the link and unzipping it, let&amp;#39;s visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fdv/typo/wiki/Installing-Typo&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; as suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just worked with the doc and updated the wiki page fix some inaccuracies and omissions, so hopefully it&amp;#39;s current (as of today at least).  So you should be able to work your way through that to the point where you&amp;#39;re ready to run &amp;quot;rails server&amp;quot; without trouble.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get it running, and was able to run edge server pretty easily too.  Just get the latest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc]
git clone git://github.com/fdv/typo.git
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the instructions above and you should be good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Troubleshooting Passenger and Devise Problems on Ruby on Rails</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent more time than I&amp;#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first all I saw were 404 errors.  Thinking it was a Passenger issue, my first stop was to try finding out about Passenger logging.  This led me to set up my apache configuration file for this virtual host as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;XML&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ServerName myservername.com
  PassengerLogLevel 3                             &amp;lt;-- Add this line!
  DocumentRoot /var/www/apps/prjectdirectory/public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Options -Multiviews
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny 
    Allow from all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this was an early deployment effort, I also temporarily moved config/environments/development.rb to config/environments/production.rb, thus picking up some of the development time debug settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I&amp;#39;d done this, the page was at least starting to point me in the right direction, by displaying the error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc]
No route matches {:controller=&amp;gt;“devise/home”}.
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was a little more helpful than a 404 message, but not much.  The error output from passenger in the Apache log wasn&amp;#39;t much help either.  Google-Fu, StackOverflow -- nothing helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime, one thing that kept nagging at me was the fact that I was also seeing the problem if I ran the app under WebBrick using production settings (i.e.:  &amp;quot;RAILS_ENV=production rails s&amp;quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking in the Wrong Place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I find that a few minutes before a daunting software puzzler turns into trivial child&amp;#39;s play, I stop looking for the solution in the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; (according to hindsight) place.  In this case, the fact that this was also failing in WebBrick led me to conclude that what I should be troubleshooting in this case was not passenger -- but the Rails app itself.  Never mind that it worked in development -- it wasn&amp;#39;t working here, in not one but two web servers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I turned on Rails logging.  (Yay -- good answer -- and the crowd went wild!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the following line to production.rb was all I needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
config.log_level = :debug
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing that, restarting the server and navigating to mysite.com/users/sign_up, the log (in the default location of &amp;quot;log/production.log&amp;quot; showed me this call stack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc]
Started GET &amp;quot;/users/sign&lt;em&gt;up&amp;quot; for 207.183.247.194 at 2012-07-10 23:56:21 +0000
Processing by Devise::RegistrationsController#new as HTML
  Rendered devise/&lt;/em&gt;links.erb (0.5ms)
  Rendered devise/registrations/new.html.erb within layouts/application (4.4ms)
  Rendered layouts/&lt;em&gt;dev&lt;/em&gt;nav.html.erb (0.8ms)
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 18ms
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the log helpfully was pointing me to just the page where the error was happening.  Looking at the partial in &amp;quot;views/layouts/&lt;em&gt;dev&lt;/em&gt;nav.html.erb&amp;quot;, the advice of the articles I&amp;#39;d found about the problem along the way now made sense:  this was a scoping problem in a link_to call.  Actually there were a few such calls, but the solution was the same in each case:  Add a &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; to the beginning of the controller &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;.  In other words, change this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot;, :controller =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;, :action =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot;, :controller =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;/home&amp;quot;, :action =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sure that &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t considered to be a Devise controller, even in the context of rendering a Devise view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, the best way to debug Passenger and Devise problems on Rails is not to treat them as Passenger or Devise problems.   Underneath whatever&amp;#39;s broken is a Rails application, and that Rails application has excellent logging available.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Testing Devise Authentication in Rails 3.1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into a bit of a hiccup while writing tests in RSpec for a site I&amp;#39;m working on which is using Devise for authentication.  I spent a short time working through the documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Controllers-and-Views-tests-with-Rails-3-(and-rspec&quot;&gt;testing Devise using rspec and controller tests&lt;/a&gt;), only to end up stubbing my toe on the following caveat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticated routes in Rails 3
If you choose to authenticate in routes.rb, you lose the ability to test your routes via assert&lt;em&gt;routing (which combines assert&lt;/em&gt;recognizes and assert_generates, so you lose them also). It’s a limitation in Rails: Rack runs first and checks your routing information but since functional/controller tests run at the controller level, you cannot provide authentication information to Rack which means request.env[‘warden’] is nil and Devise generates one of the following errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NoMethodError: undefined method &amp;#39;authenticate!&amp;#39; for nil:NilClass
  NoMethodError: undefined method &amp;#39;authenticate?&amp;#39; for nil:NilClass
The solution is to test your routes via integration tests. Authenticating your routes has its advantages, this is one of the disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just the error I was getting when running my controller tests, so it looked like I needed to go after them in in integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately with a bit of Google-Fu, it turned out this is not an unusual problem. I was lucky to run into Andy Lindeman&amp;#39;s excellent post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alindeman.github.com/2011/09/25/testing-devise-with-rspec-request-specs-and-capybara.html&quot;&gt;Testing Devise with RSpec and Capybara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had to install CapyBara, which I hadn&amp;#39;t worked with before (See Lindeman&amp;#39;s article for details on how to install this).  I based my solution on Lindeman&amp;#39;s code, but with a couple of variations.  First, I wanted to wrap his code in a module so I could call it from any test.  Also, I modified his code to ensure that if the user was not registered, we&amp;#39;d register him, and if he was registered, we&amp;#39;d log him in.  This helped me make the code he provided easier to use and more re-entrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this in RSpec, I added the following line to spec_helper.rb in the spec directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
    config.extend RequestMacros, :type =&amp;gt; :request
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That done, I added the module code to a new file, spec/support/request_macros.rb.  As you can see in the snippet below, it looks for the user in the database, and if not found, registers the user (which logs the user in as a side effect).  If the user is found, it logs the user in.  (I&amp;#39;ve coded the email and password here along the way, but this could be DRY&amp;#39;ed up a bit by getting the user information from FactoryGirl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
module RequestMacros 
  def login&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;admin
   before(:each) do
      # Ensure registered
      email = &amp;quot;someone@test.com&amp;quot;
      password = &amp;quot;password&amp;quot;
      user = User.find&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt;email(email)
      if user.nil?
        visit &amp;quot;/users/sign&lt;em&gt;up&amp;quot;
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Email&amp;quot;,                 :with =&amp;gt; email 
        fill&lt;em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password&amp;quot;,              :with =&amp;gt; password
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password confirmation&amp;quot;, :with =&amp;gt; password
        click&lt;em&gt;button &amp;quot;Sign up&amp;quot;
        page.should have&lt;/em&gt;content(&amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot;)
      else
        visit &amp;quot;/users/sign&lt;em&gt;in&amp;quot;
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Email&amp;quot;,                 :with =&amp;gt; email 
        fill&lt;em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password&amp;quot;,              :with =&amp;gt; password
        click&lt;/em&gt;button &amp;quot;Sign in&amp;quot;
      end
   end
  end
end
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, because in integration testing we&amp;#39;re not really testing Rails objects but are dealing with input and output as the web browser sees it, I had to set up a test page to verify that things were working as planned.  I&amp;#39;ll no doubt yank this page later as I develop &amp;quot;real tests&amp;quot; for the functionality I want, and develop the functionality along with the tests.  In the meantime, the target test page (views/people/test.html.erb) is simplicity itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;rails&amp;quot;]
&amp;lt;%= 
if user&lt;em&gt;signed&lt;/em&gt;in? 
  &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;
else
  &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;
end
%&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this done and the route for the test in place (we don&amp;#39;t need a controller method because the default rendering will pick up the view), we&amp;#39;re now ready for the test itself, in spec/requests/people_spec.rb. (Assuming you want to test the &amp;quot;PeopleController&amp;quot;, if not, modify this and the view location to suit). You&amp;#39;ll see we test that we can log in a second time as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
require &amp;#39;spec_helper&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;describe &amp;quot;People&amp;quot;, :type =&amp;gt; :request do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;login&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;admin &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it &amp;quot;signs&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;in&amp;quot; do
   visit &amp;quot;/people/test&amp;quot;
   page.should have_content(&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;)
  end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it &amp;quot;signs&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;in&lt;em&gt;again&amp;quot; do
   visit &amp;quot;/people/test&amp;quot;
   page.should have&lt;/em&gt;content(&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;)
  end
end
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the spec as below to verify that it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
rake spec SPEC=spec/requests/people_spec.rb
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that will save you a few minutes of time.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How I Became a Ruby on Rails Contractor (Trapped in a Microsoft Programmer&#39;s Body)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I work in a Microsoft shop during the day working mostly on legacy code written in C, C++, C#, and some VB.NET. There was an incident at work recently that turned me into a Rails Contractor, through some interesting alchemy involving pointy hair, which I will describe below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before telling you my war story, a bit about my Rails experience: I learned Rails the same way I learned every language and framework I know -- by coding in it in my spare time.  I&amp;#39;ve made my living as a programmer / web developer doing that since about 1993.  Currently I&amp;#39;m working on a private Rails project, which is probably a bad thing since I can&amp;#39;t point to it on Github and show you my stuff.  I&amp;#39;ll fix that shortly by doing some public rails work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to the war story. As I said, I work mainly on legacy code. In his excellent book on the subject, Michael Feathers defines legacy code as code that&amp;#39;s not under test. That&amp;#39;s what I work on -- vast expanses of code through which dozens of programmers have slogged since Regan was in office. The first development time unit tests in the system were tests that I added, and I only came here some four years ago, so that tells you how long this untested code had been hacked on. So needless to say, it&amp;#39;s been a challenge to get tests in after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is our software &amp;quot;process&amp;quot;: For major releases, our software goes through QA, running whatever tests we have. The quality is poor, so we have multiple service packs to fix it, which also go through QA. But because our test coverage isn&amp;#39;t what it should be, the quality of the service packs is poor. Our solution to this is to send out &amp;quot;Emergency Patches&amp;quot; -- releases that don&amp;#39;t go through QA testing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you really read that right, and it really said that.  To fix our quality problems, we patch our software, test the patch, but we don&amp;#39;t send the software back to QA to run whatever scant regression tests we have -- we just send the patch out the door.  Problem?  What problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Software Death Spiral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday one of my bosses asked me why we were having regressions in one area of the product. I work on database drivers, and the area in question was our handling of Oracle LONGs, a data type that Oracle deprecated in 1997, when Bill Clinton was president. I replied that we don&amp;#39;t have regression tests for it in the suite that QA runs, and that it wasn&amp;#39;t too much work to add them, but would leave us in the position of certifying our product against another vendor&amp;#39;s deprecated type. So this development manager talks to the manager of technical support, who&amp;#39;s job it is to tell us which fixes we ship without testing, which she determines according to the customer screaming for the fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our process is CSDD: Customer Screaming Driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer I received was that the support manager &amp;quot;agreed&amp;quot; with me that we don&amp;#39;t need regression tests for LONGs. We just need &amp;quot;something very targeted and specifc: a fix for this one problem...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the manager&amp;#39;s solution for the regressions he was asking me about was to do more patches in that area without regression testing, and to attribute the idea to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at that very moment that I became a Ruby on Rails Contractor.  To be sure, I was occupying the space of a nominal .NET / C# / C++ / C programmer, but now I was a Rails Contractor sitting in the wrong chair.  Echos of my old career as a contractor came back to me, where I was able to fight and win the battle of Test First Development in a Java shop, before Ruby on Rails was invented.  As a result, we found and killed all kinds of problems that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have otherwise.  (That was shortly after teaching myself Java, as it happens.  Learn.  Do.  Learn more.  Do more.  That&amp;#39;s the cycle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is not a magic bullet, of course, but at least a framework that includes unit tests baked in -- as well as gems like Rspec and FactoryGirl and Capybara -- has a fighting chance of attracting one or two managers who understand that testing is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave me a comment if you&amp;#39;re such a manager. I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Yet Another Code Formatting Test</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t too satisfied with the last code formatting gizmo I used.  So I&amp;#39;ve been experimenting with  kpumuk&amp;#39;s awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codecolorer/&quot;&gt;CodeColorer&lt;/a&gt; plugin.  I&amp;#39;m loving the results, see below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[cc lang=&amp;quot;ruby&amp;quot;]
module RequestMacros 
  def login&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;admin
   before(:each) do
      # Ensure registered
      email = &amp;quot;someone@test.com&amp;quot;
      password = &amp;quot;password&amp;quot;
      user = User.find&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt;email(email)
      if user.nil?
        visit &amp;quot;/users/sign&lt;em&gt;up&amp;quot;
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Email&amp;quot;,                 :with =&amp;gt; email 
        fill&lt;em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password&amp;quot;,              :with =&amp;gt; password
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password confirmation&amp;quot;, :with =&amp;gt; password
        click&lt;em&gt;button &amp;quot;Sign up&amp;quot;
        page.should have&lt;/em&gt;content(&amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot;)
      else
        visit &amp;quot;/users/sign&lt;em&gt;in&amp;quot;
        fill&lt;/em&gt;in &amp;quot;Email&amp;quot;,                 :with =&amp;gt; email 
        fill&lt;em&gt;in &amp;quot;Password&amp;quot;,              :with =&amp;gt; password
        click&lt;/em&gt;button &amp;quot;Sign in&amp;quot;
      end
   end
  end
end
[/cc]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far my tests in the Visual Editor didn&amp;#39;t work out too well even when following the directions.  However I&amp;#39;m very pleased with the result I get in the non-visual editor, and one can always type one&amp;#39;s own HTML for any post with code in it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Buying Too Much Crap, and What It Might Be Like to Stop</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I buy too much crap.  The chances are pretty good that you do, too.  Actually, the chances are even better that you&amp;#39;re a spambot, but let&amp;#39;s leave to one side the issue of my low readership for now.  If you&amp;#39;re here as a human denizen of the interwebs, you probably buy about as much crap as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I started writing down how much crap I buy, and the unusual effect of that, a couple of days later, is that what I really want to do is start an experiment where I don&amp;#39;t buy any crap for a period of time -- let&amp;#39;s say a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there&amp;#39;s food and rent and all that, and there are the inevitable and welcome social obligations to spend money on -- dinner with my daughter and flowers for my wife, the two things I bought on Wednesday when I began writing things down.  But there&amp;#39;s no need to buy all that other crap that may sing it&amp;#39;s little &amp;quot;Buy Me&amp;quot; siren song in my ear over the next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about buying a book I saw yesterday, partly for me and partly for my wife.  The irony of this thought is that I saw the book in a public library, where borrowing the book wouldn&amp;#39;t have cost me a cent, and I would have less crap to put on a shelf at the end of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not be a bad thing.  The shelves are already doing OK.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cupboards are doing even better. My wife and I have, as of this moment, in the house (leaving off my stash at work), some fifteen boxes of teabags.  Now even with that, a week ago I bought a loose leaf tea infuser and some tea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell do I need an infuser for, when I have a cupboard with fifteen boxes of tea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I wanted one.  I went up on Amazon -- yes, of course I&amp;#39;m an Amazon Prime member, are you kidding me?  I went up on Amazon and the crap-buying centers of my brain instantly lit up like a department store Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have a tea infuser, and a notebook to write down the crap I buy.  I&amp;#39;m proud to say I used an existing notebook for that -- no new crap to track the crap.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I am going to start using up the tea.  In order to enjoy my new purchase, I&amp;#39;m going to bring some of those boxes to work and use my free work scissors to cut them open -- hey presto, loose leaf tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let you know how it all goes.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>checking for mysql_query() in mysqlclient.lib... no</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week in Ruby pain, I was trying to install the mysql gem and was having a bit of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution turned out to be some combination of the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre data-line=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;language-bash&#39;&gt;sudo apt-get install libmysql-ruby
sudo aptitude install libmysqlclient16-dev
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mysql/ /usr/local/lib/mysql

				<title>Testing a Code Markup Plugin</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I just installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/code-markup-wordpress-plugin/&quot;&gt;Code Markup Plugin&lt;/a&gt; and thought I&amp;#39;d give it a bit of a test drive.  Some HTML and PHP ought to be enough to prove the concept, I would think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;[code lang=&amp;quot;php&amp;quot;]
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
      
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
[/code]

				<title>This Week in my Unhired Rails Developer Journey</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of good Rails stuff done this week, mixed in with only a little bit of career train wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not one of your cool kids.  I don&amp;#39;t own a Mac.  I make mistakes.  Move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided that not only was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2009/05/29/a-farewell-to-slickedit/&quot;&gt;SlickEdit not worth the upgrade as a Rails environment&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, it&amp;#39;s still not.  Although in fairness at least they&amp;#39;re now doing something for their legacy customers in the way of discounting that they weren&amp;#39;t doing when I wrote that other article, in terms of Rails they seem to be pretty much have about the same support as they did two years ago, which is to say, not much.   Making this decision meant I had to make some serious new finger-memory investment in gvim, which I&amp;#39;ve started to do with the help of the excellent book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccf-holland.org/click5.html&quot;&gt;Learning Vi and Vim&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#39;ve been using gvim in a naive way for years -- it&amp;#39;s time to become an expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding ruby support to Vim also means getting the right vim plugins.  This is still a work in progress, but I&amp;#39;m doing pretty well already with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567&quot;&gt;rails plugin&lt;/a&gt; only, so maybe it isn&amp;#39;t really a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumpstarted my current aprojectx project (that would be:  &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; so it shows up first on Git, and &amp;quot;project x&amp;quot; so I don&amp;#39;t have to change its name if I decide it needs to turn into something other than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gFCW3PHBws&quot;&gt;what it&amp;#39;s trying to be lately)&lt;/a&gt;. Before I met the OpenGovernment folks I had a project started which to date only really had a preliminary theme and Devise set up, which is fairly trivial to do given Devise&amp;#39;s clean design.  So that became the basis for the current project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aprojectx is of course checked in to Github as a private project, meaning that not only have I not yet told you what aprojectx is trying to be lately, I have it in a secret hiding place.  So as of this moment it&amp;#39;s on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0cF2piwjYQ&quot;&gt;Double Secret Probation&lt;/a&gt;.  Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The career train wreck I had earlier in the week did have one advantage, in that it allowed me to ramp up a little on Rspec, Rake, and even a bit into a sort of hand-coded fixture support.  The takeaway for now is that I got rake installed and ready so I can do Behavior Driven Double Secret Probation.  You&amp;#39;ve no doubt heard of this, especially if unlike me you are are a mac-owning cool kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have Rspec in place for the next phase of development, which was to swap out the current database implementation for MongoDB, which means getting rid of ActiveRecord, the first task so far that might take more than about fifteen minutes of easy work, not because it&amp;#39;s hard in itself, but because I may have to write some Mongo-based Devise models.  Since that may be of general interest, I might release that as open source, if seven people haven&amp;#39;t already done it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alas, before I could do that, I had a bit of a deployment interlude.  I did a trial deployment to a sample EngineYard account; that all went pretty well until I arrived at an error which pointed to the fact that I&amp;#39;d nestled my rails app a level in from the root because conceptually AProjectX also has a non-Rails component to it.  EngineYard doesn&amp;#39;t like having your rails app not be the root Github application.  So I think I&amp;#39;ll fix that now, now that my gorgeous wife and I are back from getting my bicycle fixed and looking at bikes for her as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, it&amp;#39;s Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Taking Another Look At Python</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The first few times I encountered Python was in a local bookstore, and I think the same book was there each time.  Each time I was immediately put off by this unfortunate volume, which seemed to suggest that the greatest thing about Python was the whitespace, and gave me the impression that whitespace was more significant than it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite.  It turns out that there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language&quot;&gt;Whitespace language&lt;/a&gt;) (who knew?), but Python isn&amp;#39;t it.  Well, I do hate making mistakes, but it seems the myth about whitespace being significant in Python is pretty common, enough so for at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk&quot;&gt;one author&lt;/a&gt; to dispel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m into my third or fourth look at Phython now, and I&amp;#39;m starting to get why so many programmers like it.  First, Python&amp;#39;s design and culture are based on being as simple and as obvious as possible. Forcing correct indentation is one example.  The Pythonic question to ask is not why you should be forced to indent correctly, but for heaven&amp;#39;s sake, why would you want the freedom to do it wrong?  &amp;quot;As Alex Martelli put it in his &lt;em&gt;Pyhon Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; (2nd ed., p. 230): &amp;#39;To describe something as clever is NOT considered a compliment in the Python culture.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obviousness of Python shines through brilliantly in the Windows binaries, including Idle, which has the incredible good manners to include a really good searchable help system (that&amp;#39;s also available directly through a chm file).  A windows help system on Windows?  What were these people thinking?  The Ruby approach:  &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t do Ruby on Windows, Get a  Mac, and by the way, documentation violates the DRY principle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the flame wars start I should point out that I like Ruby enough to be volunteering on an open source project that&amp;#39;s written in it and would love to work in a Ruby shop.  Ruby has some incredible strengths, but clarity is not one of them.  As Clark Maurer &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.slickedit.com/2007/09/comparing-python-to-perl-and-ruby/&quot;&gt;nailed it&lt;/a&gt; in his demonstration of a typical Ruby yield statement plus block mess:  &amp;quot;What planet did this come from?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it seems like being clever is a hallmark of youth.  As a younger man I was a clever C++ programmer.  Older programmers have generally slogged through enough of other people&amp;#39;s trying-to-be-clever code to hold being prosaic and obvious as virtues.  Yes, if I had a down and dirty script that had to get done, I&amp;#39;d rather write it in Perl, where I can be clever, but six months later, I&amp;#39;d rather maintain it in Python, when the obviousness I was forced to adopt at the start begins to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being clever is fun, and the speed boost is exhilarating.  If you&amp;#39;re being clever, believe me, I understand the allure.  But take my advice -- cut it out and be obvious.  Your future self will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Back into Rails</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t wanted to really dig into a software language in a long time, but I&amp;#39;ve been brushing up my Ruby and Rails skills and enjoying it thoroughly. It&amp;#39;s still fun even if I only get to do it in my spare time. I haven&amp;#39;t had the pleasure of making money at it yet, and currently I make a living digging up dinosaur bones in what we will charitably call C++ since that&amp;#39;s what the file extensions seem to denote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinosaur bones. Well, what the hell, I&amp;#39;m an old guy. We tend to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the Rails frenzy about? Well it&amp;#39;s certainly not about working, at least in the short term. There isn&amp;#39;t a Rails job within 50 miles of here. Sacramento is the land that time forgot, like that Twilight Zone episode where the guy gets off the train and it&amp;#39;s the 1920&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real genesis of the thing started when I wanted to put a web site together that would support and allow open Direct Democracy. The idea is that we&amp;#39;d take Congressional voting records and develop a sort of report card as to the extent to which our representatives did -- or didn&amp;#39;t -- represent us. Of course, the foregone conclusion is that they don&amp;#39;t, but in the process of finding that out, we might arrive at a more perfect union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stranger things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out trying to tackle this beast in PHP, and dug into CakePHP as a way of avoiding the two problems I always had to avoid when working on Rails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hosting sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to work on Rails in Windows is like trying to speak Chinese in Venezuela. Sure, you can do it, but if your goal is Chinese, you&amp;#39;re really better off in China. Which in the case of Rails means a Linux box or a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was that solving this problem via CakePHP is like solving having car trouble by buying a toy car. CakePHP runs brilliantly on Apache Windows and I&amp;#39;m sure hosting would be a breeze, but compared to Rails it turns out to be somewhat limiting, both in the maturity of the platform and the size of the community of developers and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as we speak, a copy of Paragon Hard Disk Manager 11 is running in the background, backing up a big old Windows partition before moving a bunch of stuff around and installing dual boot Linux, which it will also help me do. Then this laptop will become a laptop again, and my wife can use the desktop Linux machine that&amp;#39;s just sitting in the living room gathering dust as a real desktop machine. The total cost of this solution is well over a thousand bucks less than the Macbook Air I&amp;#39;m drooling over, but until we find Jenniffer a job here in the US (she&amp;#39;s a Drafter with lots of Autodesk if you know anyone), I&amp;#39;m in &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s do it on the cheap&amp;quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the last few weeks I&amp;#39;ve been re-exploring the Rails world, and finding all sorts of goodies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. OK, GitHub has been there for several years, but I only recently set up an account, first for my CakePHP stuff and later for the Rails work. I paid a few bucks to be able to keep private repositories, but I&amp;#39;m also possibly going to do some Open Source work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-i/&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/a&gt;.  OK, yes, Cucumber too but to my untrained eyes so far I must say Cucumber looks wordy enough to step outside the boundaries of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain&amp;#x27;t_gonna_need_it&quot;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;, whereas RSpec still seems pretty clean.  Tomayto, Tomahto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russ Olsen&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1325954089&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Eloquent Ruby&lt;/a&gt;.  This is one of those books that does a great job of putting the language into some sort of context, and does so in a way both teaches you more about the language and lets you make sense of it at the same time.  This one&amp;#39;s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/a&gt;.  Want to have feature rich web site registration and authentication pretty much ready to rock and roll in about half an hour?  There you go.  By way of comparison, I spent maybe half a day on some stock CakePHP code to do the same thing, and it wasn&amp;#39;t even close to as done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbjarnason/open-active-democracy&quot;&gt;Open Democracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opengovernment/govkit&quot;&gt;GovKit&lt;/a&gt;, some open source projects making rolling an open democracy web site less of a development effort (oh well, so much for teaching myself things) and more of an integration effort (hey presto, learn by doing).  And hey look, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/&quot;&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; -- I&amp;#39;m digging stuff up even as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go.  Learn Ruby.  It&amp;#39;s the patriotic thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Have your Representative Co-Sponsor The People&#39;s Rights Amendment</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a very good email yesterday from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/&quot;&gt;Free Speech for People&lt;/a&gt; summarizing some of the progress we&amp;#39;re making against corporate personhood, encouraging me to ask my representative to co-sponsor the People&amp;#39;s Rights Amendment house resolution, which overturns Citizens United.  (Read the resolution in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/sites/default/files/Peoples%20Rights%20Amendment.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF format&lt;/a&gt;).  Here&amp;#39;s the suggestion, which I&amp;#39;ve followed (and urge you to do the same).  It took me about 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;tel:202-225-3121&quot;&gt;202-225-3121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;tel:202-224-3121&quot;&gt;202-224-3121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (either one should work), to reach the U.S. Capitol switchboard.  Give the operator your zip code and ask to speak to your Representative (not your Senators).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re connected, let the staff know you’re a constituent, then ask your Rep. to &lt;strong&gt;co-sponsor&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;People’s Rights Amendment -- H J Res 88&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Open Letter to State Senator Ted Gaines </title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As I wrote to your colleague in the State Assembly, Dr. Richard Pan, I have recently moved into your district from El Dorado County and will be updating my voter registration shortly.  I was able to confirm with your office that I am a constituent of yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to call your attention to, and earnestly request your support for, a matter which we hope will be before the State Senate in 2012, State Assembly bill &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_1101-1150/ab_1148_bill_20110426_amended_asm_v98.html&quot;&gt;AB-1148&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a bill to improve the reporting requirements on political mailers and commercials, so that the voting public is aware of the real supporters of legislation.  As you&amp;#39;re aware, at present we are presented with choices that look something like &amp;quot;Concerned Citizens for the Cuteness of Babies&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Patriotic Grandmothers Against Illegal Activity&amp;quot; when the real supporters of legislation and political races are hidden from view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a concrete example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/10/prop-26-prop-23-californi/&quot;&gt;Chevron spent some $3.75M &lt;/a&gt;in California to support Proposition 26, a ballot measure that was also heavily financed by Philip Morris.  This is hardly surprising, since it restricted our ability to impose fees on those who harm the public to those measures that could garner a 2/3 vote.  Meantime, the supporter of Proposition 26 was listed as: &amp;quot;Stop Hidden Taxes—No on 25/Yes on 26, a coalition of taxpayers, small businesses,  environmental experts, good government  groups, minorities, farmers, and vineyards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is legal fraud, pure and simple.  As an insurance man, I&amp;#39;m sure you know that if an insurance agent in your employ were to sell a policy based on the sort of deceptive practices embodied here, his license (and likely yours) would be put at some risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bill has the support of conservatives and liberals alike, polling as supported by 86% of Democrats, 78% of Republicans, and a whopping 88% of independents.  This too is not surprising.  Honesty and transparency in government are neither conservative nor liberal issues -- they are issues of morality and functioning citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I submit to you that what&amp;#39;s at issue here is not whether your support regulation (to which, in general, I see you are opposed), but whether you support it to the extent of being willing to defend flagrant crony capitalism and lying to your constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I recently wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/2011/12/05/dr-richard-pan-state-assemblyman-an-open-letter/&quot;&gt;a similar message&lt;/a&gt; to Dr. Richard Pan, and I have not yet heard from him.  You might take this opportunity to show that as a Republican you can nevertheless beat a Democrat to the punch by taking a principled stand against crony capitalism.   I look forward to hearing your positive response so that I may share it with my readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Lockwood
Orangevale, CA&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dr. Richard Pan - State Assemblyman - An Open Letter On AB-1148</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I went to my State Assembly representative&amp;#39;s web site and sent him the following letter.  I hope to receive a positive response from him so I can post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Pan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to Orangevale from El Dorado County, and will be changing my voter registration within a few days to reflect that I am a constituent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to call your most earnest attention to AB-1148, The California Disclose Act, a bill that I enthusiastically support (along with 86% of Democrats, 78% of Republicans, and a whopping 88% of independents).  I recently joined CAClean as a volunteer Working Group leader, and intend to do everything I can including petition drives, etc. to bring awareness to this issue in your district.  Naturally, if you would work toward and support this popular, moral, and utterly uncontroversial legislation, you will not only be doing the citizens of your district a valuable service, but I will personally do all I can to let the voters know that you have pledged your support to get money out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know you personally, and have every reason to believe you to be an honest and hardworking public servant.  As a Physician and educator, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve been frustrated with the way that insurance and drug companies are calling the shots and tying your professional hands, to the detriment of the health of your patients.  Moreover, as a clean money candidate, I believe you stand to gain huge popular wins for as long as you may wish to serve, and I will commit to doing everything I can between now and your next election to make sure that happens, by letting that 84% of your Democratic base and as many of the 88% of independents as possible know that you are a true servant of the public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of the Occupy Movement is a testament to how frustrated the electorate is with money in politics, and I believe your support of this bill will be a huge populist win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to get the money out of politics.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience that I can count on your  support, so I can look forward to toasting your health at your 2012 victory party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Lockwood&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My News Tip for the Huffington Post</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I sent the following news tip today to the Huffington Post. Please add your voice to mine to ask them to cover it. This is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, please, please cover this story. It is hugely important for our nation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anonymous author has written a document / petition called &amp;quot;The New Common Sense&amp;quot;, which is being circulated among Occupy folks (see for example) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.occupyoakland.org/2011/11/the-new-common-sense&quot;&gt;http://www.occupyoakland.org/2011/11/the-new-common-sense&lt;/a&gt; or the online petition at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/petitions/the-new-common-sense&quot;&gt;https://www.change.org/petitions/the-new-common-sense &lt;/a&gt;(There&amp;#39;s a version at whitehouse.gov too but it is completely unusual).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although perhaps originating with Occupy, far from being a leftist screed, it is a call for a return to a government that is responsible for preserving and defending the Constitution (duh). Progressive Radio host Thom Hartman calls it awesome and brilliant and I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A TeaParty and Occupy Friendly Roadmap for a Truly Representative Government</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On January 10, 1776, some six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine published a pamphlet that became (relative to the population at the time) the most widely read book in U.S. history, Common Sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning my reading brought me across a link to a fascinating document called &amp;quot;The New Common Sense&amp;quot;, which provides a balanced yet serious way forward out of our dysfunctional government.   I reprint it here by permission (the&lt;a href=&quot;http://pastebin.com/gm2UV08D&quot;&gt; original document&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s full title reads:  &amp;quot;For the 99% - The NEW COMMON SENSE - Must distribute FAST! - Pastebin.com&amp;quot;).  It&amp;#39;s long but worth it!  (For those who just want the gist, click forward to the section OUR PETITION).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Unity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE NEW COMMON SENSE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Declaration of INTERDEPENDENCE, born of necessity, from and for the collective conscience of the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; to and for the oligarchic &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; of the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SECTION I: The Right to Equal Participation in Government has been taken from the People and is explained. -- A Plan is offered to restore the Right to Equal Participation that requires only the use of tools and procedures that have already been proven to work. -- The restoration of Equality must take priority above all and reasons are given. -- Outside damaging influences must no longer be allowed privileged access to Elected Representatives in a Constitutional Republic. -- An Offer in Compromise that would reunite this Nation with its Foundation is clearly stated. -- A clear, workable and simple method by which we may rebuild ourselves as a Prosperous Nation and return to being One Hundred Percent is explained. -- A New Litmus Test of our government is declared and explained. -- A plan and petition to rebalance the Branches of Government is outlined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SECTION II: Monitions are forwarded to our Leaders, to the Congress in specific, to the Media, to Law Enforcement and the Domestic Militia, and to the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; -- A direct message and plea for the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; from the author(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SECTION I - Common Sense from the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION AND PREAMBLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the Citizens of a Nation to petition their own Government for a redress of grievances, the People have a duty to exercise their rights under the First Amendment collectively if they so choose. To this end, We the People hereby assert our right to peacefully assemble and petition our Government for redress when we feel that this is our best, and perhaps only remaining option to seek remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We affirm that any lasting and workable solution must reach beyond mere politics, that political issues do not matter at a time when our collective voice has been nearly silenced. We believe that the current political climate has caused a paralysis of our Government. We find that our individual opinions mean little when we are no longer being properly represented. In fact, we believe that the Balance of Power between the Branches of our Government has been corrupted to the point where it can answer only to members of an affluent and politically active upper class. The impending result of this imbalance is that government of the People, by the People, for the People has almost perished from Our Nation. We believe that government has been influenced by an external source that has conspired to control it to the point of stalemate. We believe that this was forced upon us by &amp;quot;special interests&amp;quot;, corporations, lobbyists, the banking and the financial sector including Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, who together have used unrestrained financial leverage leading to the corruption of many politicians, regardless of their political party, resulting in great damage to the People and to this Nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all are created equal regardless of their financial status. -- That we free Citizens of the United States are without exception endowed under a Federal Constitution granting us certain unalienable Rights. -- That among these Rights are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure and protect these rights, our forefathers drafted this Constitution, ratified by the then several States and agreed to by the People. -- That this Constitution defines and protects us all with a system of Checks and Balances by which the powers and responsibilities of government would be divided amongst the Federal, the States and the People. -- That this original Social Contract in which those powers were granted has been repeatedly violated by the Federal government. -- That we no longer are represented by our Government. -- That we no longer have a voice in our Government. -- That the limits of power of the Federal Government have been deliberately and repeatedly breached. -- That our Government has become destructive towards the vast majority of the same People that they are supposed to protect. -- That outside influences have gained unreasonable power and influence within our Government. -- That the Fair Election system is being systematically dismantled and no longer allows for a full, on paper, verification and accounting of actual balloting. -- That We the People have the Fundamental Right and Patriotic Duty under the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights to peacefully assemble and to demand that the Government cease and desist from or correct any of these violations. -- That the Government cede back to the States and to the People all such Powers that they have unconstitutionally seized, regaining such Powers from the States via Constitutional Amendment if they are to have them at all. -- That our Government must Right these encroachments on the People by realigning itself to the Constitution. -- That vague interpretations of the Constitution should be clarified through civil discourse leading to a series of new Amendments and with full participation by the several States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hold that the Constitution was originally designed to prevent the Federal government from encroaching upon the rights of the People and the States. Adjustments to Federal Powers were to be made only via Constitutional Amendment. We hold that this Amendment procedure has largely been ignored in recent history. In fact, when the Constitution was originally crafted, the political party as we know it today did not even exist. The modern era of rampant partisanship was not even envisioned by the Founders. We thus believe that the current &amp;quot;political party system&amp;quot; as it stands has served to divide this Nation to the point of paralysis. As a Great former President once said, &amp;quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we who have named ourselves the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; may each have our own individual personal concerns and grievances, we know that we must set them aside at this time due to a more pressing need to demand the return of the Representation that has been taken from us. Until such time, we contend that nothing can be accomplished in a spirit of true discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively we can all certainly agree upon these Truths that have led us to our outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hold that the branches of Federal government have been corrupted, convoluted and debased, that they have all strayed from their intended purpose, standing idly by while their effectiveness and objectivity have been debased by a conglomerate, known to us as the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; we mean specifically those from an aristocracy who manipulate government in their own self-interests: the affluent &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot;, the bankers, the corporations and the special interests who use their wealth and financial power as leverage to gain an unreasonable lobbying influence on government legislation and policies. They most often do this in ways that harm the common People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; as the common citizen, the employed and the unemployed, the poor and the disabled, the aged, the disadvantaged, the students, the public and civil servants with a conscience, the lower and middle classes, even those honest politicians and members of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; itself who refuse to &amp;quot;buy into&amp;quot; this oligarchy. We include all of these and more regardless of our individual affiliations, political leanings, opinions, beliefs, religions, our race, ethnic background, sex, age or even financial status. We are the People of real flesh and blood. We represent all walks of life from all corners of this Nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall offer and elaborate on examples which will help illustrate where we believe that the four branches of government have now failed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE JUDICIAL BRANCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article III, Section 1 of the United States Constitution reads in part, &amp;quot;The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior...&amp;quot; yet there is no clear definition of &amp;quot;good Behavior&amp;quot; given, nor does recent history show us any consistent method of accountability that protects the People or the States from judicial &amp;quot;bad Behavior&amp;quot;. Indeed, the phrase &amp;quot;good Behavior&amp;quot; has been historically misinterpreted to mean &amp;quot;appointed for life.&amp;quot; These permanent appointments result in Judges that become firmly entrenched and nearly unaccountable to the People for the decisions that they make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that due to this misinterpretation, the Supreme Court has obtained unbalanced, far-reaching powers well beyond the intention of our forefathers. The People have no reasonable recourse if these Judges prove to be partisan and refuse to rule in the Best Interest--or if they fail to uphold and defend the Constitution. Justices appointed for life terms can easily dodge accountability, as history has so proven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many examples of truly questionable Supreme Court decisions exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), the Court decided that corporations were recognized as &amp;quot;persons&amp;quot; for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. This gave corporations the same legal rights as a living, breathing individual. Yet, the corporations enjoy other legal protections not afforded to real persons, such as tax shelters and loopholes, liability shields and others. This grants them unbalanced protections that lead directly to unfair opportunities for governmental influence at a disproportionate level than that of the People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, No. 08-205, (2010), the Court ruled 5-4 that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. This decision in part lead to the creation of the &amp;quot;super PAC&amp;quot;, by which corporations, special interests and the affluent can donate unlimited amounts of money anonymously through 501(c)(4) corporations, leaving the entire political process unaccountable, untraceable and with the People unable to execute a Public audit of the funding of political campaigns. The Supreme Court also struck down those provisions of the McCain–Feingold Act, Public Law 107-155 (2001) that prohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, as well as unions from broadcasting &amp;quot;electioneering communications.&amp;quot; Alarmingly, the decision itself also notes that, &amp;#39;It might also be added that corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their &amp;quot;personhood&amp;quot; often serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of &amp;quot;We the People&amp;quot; by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.&amp;#39; If this is the case, why then were they given the same rights as flesh and blood persons under the Fourteenth Amendment when they arguably are not equal? How can the common People compete against such invisible and unaccountable financial influence upon politics? The consequences of this have been disastrous. This form of court-sponsored &amp;quot;political &amp;quot;money laundering&amp;quot; has served to corrupt our system in favor of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general attitude that the Supreme Court is perfect and void of corruption internally and thus remain immune from scrutiny has caused yet more damage. Our history is rife with examples of the Judiciary overstepping their bounds. In fact, one case illustrates their large contribution towards the start of Civil War. In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857), the Court ruled 7-2 that people of African descent brought into the United States and held as slaves (or their descendants, whether or not they were slaves) were not protected by the Constitution, could not sue in court and could never be U.S. citizens. It took the Civil War, the loss of countless lives and not one but two Constitutional Amendments (Amendments Thirteen and Fourteen) to even begin to repair the damage that the Court inflicted on the People with this decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even with two Amendments ratified after the War, that were in part intended to prevent the supreme and all lower courts from continuing to make such socially divisive decisions of this nature, the Supreme Court later opted to breach even these key additions to the Constitution in future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over thirty years beyond the end of the Civil War, in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), the Court voted 7-1 in favor of upholding the constitutionality of state laws requiring racial segregation in private businesses (particularly railroads), under the doctrine of &amp;quot;separate but equal&amp;quot;. This segregation between races remained standard doctrine in U.S. law until its unanimous repudiation in the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), fifty-eight years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a decision that the court made in 1857 helped launch a Civil War and it took two Constitutional Amendments in 1862 and 1868 followed by approximately one hundred more years of civil unrest and divisive Court decisions until these issues finally began to resolve. To this day these issues still remain unresolved to a certain degree; such is the damage that has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, a more recent decision that clearly illustrates how the Court exceeds its jurisdiction and breaches Constitutional authority can be offered. Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962) was a landmark case that for the first time retreated from the &amp;quot;political question doctrine&amp;quot; (the test of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear a specific case). The details of this case itself are far less important than the effect that it had on our System of Justice. In this case, the Court ceased to limit themselves only to cases based upon a legal question per the doctrine. Instead, they chose to exceed their jurisdiction and authority by ruling on a political dispute instead of a legal one, and over an issue internal to a single State no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker v. Carr not only violated the doctrine but it set a new precedent that has, under the banner of  stare decisis (a legal principle by which judges are generally obliged to respect the precedents established by prior decisions), has led to even more violations by the Court going forward. Never was it intended for the Court to decide individual internal State issues, but now the Court takes on many of these cases regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cases prove the need for an urgent return to a staunch reliance upon the Constitutional Amendment procedure as our method of restraint against the Court and we must remember to rely on it as our first course of action in these situations. This was the intent of the Constitution as it was written. It is what made our Constitution a &amp;quot;living document&amp;quot; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we have now shown, sometimes even Amendments fail to keep the Court in check. We suggest that a serious reconsideration be given regarding term limits for Justices or for some other remedy upon which we can all agree to further curtail this danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We maintain that the liberty of &amp;quot;vague interpretation&amp;quot; is not for the Court to enjoy for they are bound by oath to remain impartial and not stray too far from their constitutionally defined boundaries. Clearly they were not meant to hold power that gives them the right to decide cases that are beyond the scope of the Constitution and that lie out of their jurisdiction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Title 28, Chapter I, Part 453 of the United States Code, each Supreme Court Justice takes the following oath:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I, [NAME], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as [TITLE] under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So help me God.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This oath, we believe, is no longer respected as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People have lost their ability to seek redress against such injustice due to the failure of government at all levels to pursue the Constitutional Amendment with which to enforce and more clearly define Court boundaries. Since appeals or requests for reviews are not allowed by the People, apathy from Congress and the States has nurtured a Supreme Court that need answer to no one, not even to the Constitution itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no longer acceptable by The People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hold that much of the fabric of the Constitution has been deliberately dismantled by the Congress. Over the course of time Congress has debated and passed numerous laws of questionable constitutionality, laws that the Supreme Court then upheld without comment or simply refused to review. Many of these laws served to create and endow Federal agencies with expanded Powers that were originally reserved to the States. Instead of petitioning the States to relinquish these officially via an Amendment, Congress merely took these Powers anyway, often through threat to withhold federal funding to the States, and with other forms of political blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, they use a series of vague interpretations of parts of the Constitution itself, from which they achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These breaches have occurred slowly and over time through repeated violations of the Tenth Amendment, an amendment which states, &amp;quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piecemeal seizure of Power from the States and the People also relies upon the following two Constitutional Clauses being used as excuses by which they have further effected this breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution (&amp;quot;The Necessary and Proper Clause&amp;quot;) states, &amp;quot;The Congress shall have Power - To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer there of.&amp;quot; This clause was meant only to grant Congress the power to make Federal Laws in order to aid them in executing Powers already granted to them in the Constitution and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (&amp;quot;The Commerce Clause&amp;quot;) states, &amp;quot;[The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes;&amp;quot; and has been used in combination with &amp;quot;The Necessary and Proper Clause&amp;quot; as a loophole by which they encroach upon and legislate to the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 states that &amp;quot;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of wholesale breaches of this clause by all Branches include: The privately issued &amp;quot;Federal Reserve Note&amp;quot; being forced upon us as our sole currency even though Congress only has the constitutional authority to &amp;quot;coin&amp;quot; money under Article I, Section 8. -- Debasement of our currency and private control of its value. -- Secret bailouts in the amount of trillions by the Federal Reserve (some to foreign entities including foreign banks). -- Covert military actions combined with apathy by the Legislative Branch who have failed to seek estoppel of multiple undeclared wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress and the private Federal Reserve have ceased to be fully accountable to the People in the reporting of actual receipts and expenditures, proof of which lies in their combined refusal to present a completely detailed audit to the People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency in government and the Right of Participation by the People does not cease once an election is over. Those who are elected must continue to answer to their constituents for the duration of their term(s). The Congress now acts independently of the People that they swore to represent. They now answer only to the special interests of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;, not to the People, all while they ignore the Constitutional limits and procedures that they swore an oath by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their oaths, we believe, are no longer respected as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no longer acceptable by The People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Constitutional provision or statute that explicitly permits Executive Orders. Instead, there is a vague grant of &amp;quot;executive power&amp;quot; in Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the phrase &amp;quot;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&amp;quot; in Article II, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fail to see how only the phrases &amp;quot;executive power&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&amp;quot;, when taken on their own or even in combination can serve as de-facto justification for any sitting President to claim under the Constitution the right to issue Executive Orders at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while most Executive Orders may attempt to justify themselves by claiming that their authority has been granted merely from these two phrases, history makes clear that the original intent of these orders was merely to help direct Officers of the US Executive to carry out their delegated duties and the normal operations of the Federal government itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be more obvious that this has clearly not been the case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive Orders through the years included orders that -- authorized the Secretary of War to prescribe certain areas as military zones -- arrested and relocated Japanese Americans to internment camps during World War II -- criminalized the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation and forced U.S. citizens to deliver all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve (with violations of the order punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or up to ten years in prison, or both) -- waged war without a Declaration from Congress -- restricted access by the People to the non-classified papers and communications of certain Presidents -- made up most of the &amp;quot;New Deal&amp;quot; itself -- allowed INTERPOL to operate inside the U.S. with more authority than our own FBI -- created FEMA, the National Security Council, the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Safety Administration and many other agencies that dramatically restructured government agencies as a whole, then transferred incredible amounts of unjustified Power to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it can be argued that multiple Presidents have overstepped their Constitutional bounds using the Executive Order, or via Presidential Proclamations, Determinations, Memorandums, Directives and Signing Statements by which they exceed their authority. They even use them to legislate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the use of these Executive Orders, Presidential Proclamations, Determinations, Memorandums and Directives as well as Signing Statements may or may not be unconstitutional per se (as this has rarely been challenged), we believe at the very least that they stand on shaky Constitutional ground and that their use should be reevaluated and clarified, perhaps even limited by law or by an Amendment. After all, if the permitted scope of these orders are not clearly defined, then how can anyone, even the Presidents themselves, ever know the limits of their authority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oath of President, we believe, is no longer respected as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no longer acceptable by The People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failures of the first three branches of government to abide by the Constitution have caused so much drift away from our Foundations that we now suffer the grave consequence of political paralysis. In fact, these failures have resulted in the creation of a new &amp;quot;fourth branch&amp;quot; of government that is also in large part responsible for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SPECIAL INTEREST BRANCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple questionable rulings by the Supreme Court that &amp;quot;money equals speech,&amp;quot; in combination with the privatization of the central banking system, have given rise to a new oligarchical and unconstitutional branch of government that we now term &amp;quot;The Special Interest Branch&amp;quot;.  This new branch has corrupted the Balance of Power between the original branches of our government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the piecemeal creation of this new branch occurred slowly over the course of years, some particular actions by the government including (but not limited to) The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the more recent Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) were instrumental in its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The now infamous &amp;quot;money equals speech&amp;quot; doctrine was enshrined into law with Buckley v. Valeo. This decision saw the Court uphold a Federal law (The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971) which set limits on campaign contributions yet rule that spending money to influence elections is a form of constitutionally protected free speech. The court also ruled that candidates can give unlimited amounts of money to their own campaigns. Although this decision actually upheld restrictions on the size of outside campaign contributions, it also struck down limits on expenditures, albeit temporarily. As of 2010, those with great wealth can effectively drown out the speech of average citizens anyway because Citizens United paved the way for unlimited anonymous &amp;quot;back door contributions&amp;quot;, often laundered through the 501(c)(4) corporation then funneled into the &amp;quot;super PAC&amp;quot;. We must also point out that the phrase &amp;quot;back door contributions&amp;quot; was intended to be a double entendre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These decisions have served to grant unprecedented leverage, influence and power based solely on wealth. They have created a method by which the affluent, the corporation, the unions and other well-funded &amp;quot;special interests&amp;quot; may unduly influence and shape legislation that is contrary to the Will of the People. These entities now have the ability to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; their way into the political arena anonymously, influencing those who have sworn to be the Representatives of the People in a manner which actually forces them to represent only these entities&amp;#39; own self-interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We submit that such unrestrained non-elected influence is mainly responsible for the utter stalemate and paralysis that exists in government today. Through the promotion of unreasonable partisanship combined with the outright purchasing of both candidates and those who hold office, combined with the unrelenting pressure from well-funded and powerful lobbies, a series of hard political lines have been drawn which greatly diminish the ability of the Legislative, the Judicial and the Executive branches to function impartially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We refuse to recognize this new perverse and corrupt &amp;quot;branch&amp;quot; of the Federal Government and we demand that it be expunged. No one among us, &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; alike should be given any more of a voice than anyone else in any capacity. Our Representatives themselves can no longer respond to the Will of the People due to this outside influence. This modern doctrine of &amp;quot;money equals speech&amp;quot; is wholly outrageous and must be ostracized from the government landscape at all levels and without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that only full transparency in all political campaigns and the full public disclosure of the activities, affiliations and financing of all lobbies, PACs (Political Action Committees) and &amp;quot;super PACs&amp;quot; can correct these inequities. In addition, The 501(c)(4) corporations must fully disclose their donor list or be barred from contributing to a &amp;quot;super PAC&amp;quot; or political campaign fund. Their contribution amounts and political expenditures should be limited if they are to participate at all, or otherwise they need to be forever barred from participating in political financing. In fact, the &amp;quot;super PAC&amp;quot; itself should be outlawed as it serves no true democratic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money verses more money isn&amp;#39;t democracy; it&amp;#39;s a cancer on our Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laws that guarantee the full transparency of this and of all other matters not related to National Security must be drafted, passed and vigorously enforced. And finally, a loophole free litmus test must be designed by which matters of National Security may be verified as such in order to protect the Public Right to Disclosure from any more abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this branch consists of the non-elect and non-appointed, its members need take no oath whatsoever and it is clear that they believe that they are exempt from and thus need not show any respect for the Constitution as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no longer acceptable by The People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A NEW LITMUS TEST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A litmus test shall be used by the people henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask of our government at all levels, to those holding corporate or financial power and to the media, that we be given a serious and prompt response to The New Common Sense. We call for you to accommodate it as a priority and to publicly acknowledge it without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves an important purpose as it will allow us to learn your individual true colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lend this your assistance, we will then know that you are worthy of election, reelection and/or our consumer support and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to speak out against this unfairly or if you make an attempt to discredit, slant, misreport, distort, slant, misstate, exaggerate, falsify or suppress it, then we will know that you are beholden to the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And be forewarned: if you do opt to ignore this entirely then we will be forced to assume that you guard the status quo and we will embrace you as if you were opposed. We will consider it to be similar to a plea of &amp;quot;no contest&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in a criminal court a plea of &amp;quot;no contest&amp;quot; is given the same effect as a plea of &amp;quot;guilty&amp;quot;, in this case such a plea will not protect you from the civil consequences of our negative judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OUR PETITION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we must state that we already understand the historical truth that whoever fires the first shot often loses the war. Thus, let it be known that our resistance and petitions for redress are by all intentions nonviolent and limited to lawful and rightful forms of expression under our Rights given to us by the First Amendment. We feel driven to these ends and believe that we must use these and other rightful methods because we have been otherwise precluded from equal participation by recently erected financial barriers that give unfair influence in the government to the affluent members of corporate, political and financial society. We collectively term this invading class the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;, who have together formed an oligarchy that clearly takes its position against the People, one that has used its collective financial power as a weapon against us in an attempt to reduce or even eliminate our fundamental right to participate in our own government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also believe that the government has allowed for this to happen deliberately and has actually welcomed this infiltration by the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has lead us to reach the following conclusion, of which we can surely all agree: the system as it was originally designed is now broken. Thus, we stand in protest against those who wish for it to remain broken because it is broken in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We submit that if a candidate for office is running at all, then they are most likely bought and paid for by the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;. Those who truly care and are trying to participate for the common good, however few, we see them ostracized, character assassinated, politically destroyed and harassed by the mass media and other tools of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;. We can only conclude that while in this climate, any candidate that we are given the opportunity to vote for is meaningless because we have already lost the chance to gain actual Representation for ourselves. We view any two competing candidates as two sides of the same worthless coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; now owns and controls the mass media, funds the lobbyists and sit at the heads of many  corporations including the financial institutions. With such power, they greatly intervene in the affairs of the House, the Senate, the Presidency and the Judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can blame us for the outrage we share and now express? If we still had an equal voice in our own government we would not be driven to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have previously stated, we believe that the problem is now beyond politics. Another election will solve nothing because the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; no longer have anybody to vote for who will represent us once they achieve office. Beyond this lies our serious concern for &amp;quot;electronic voting&amp;quot; systems that by design do not allow for a paper trail. This must also be remedied if our faith is to be restored. We can no longer place trust in the fairness of our own elections in large part because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, mere political issues do not matter at this time and our opinions do not matter when we are not being heard. Until we get our voice back, we must demand redress until such time as our Right to Equal Participation is returned to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We repeatedly affirm that our personal issues and affiliations (political or otherwise) while important and needful of resolve in due time, must be set aside temporarily until such a time as we regain our Equal Voice in our government. We realize that until we truly reconnect with our government that our concerns will fall upon deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that we as a Nation have lost our ability to be an example to the World of a working Representative Democracy. In order to regain the world&amp;#39;s respect, we believe that our government must again completely realign itself with the Constitution that this Nation was founded upon. We cannot sell our way of life to the rest of the world through force while we can only display a ridiculous inability to solve our own problems. Instead, we must bring about an honest desire in their collective hearts to emulate our system by fixing it. Only when we can stand again as an example to the World as a sound Constitutional Republic can we possibly regain that respect. The reality is that respect cannot be earned merely through force and these recent pursuits against parts of the world are some of our greatest mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also believe that this One Problem must be corrected before the solutions to any of our other problems can again be within our reach. We absolutely must realign ourselves with our Foundations as the priority. The paralysis will continue if we do not and we as a Nation are running out of time. How much longer can this go on? Compromise in government discourse will remain impossible if we do not repair the Platform that we all absolutely must stand upon and recommit to It our full respects. If we do not do this immediately then we as a Nation face certain doom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is strong language, we know. Therefore, we must now make clear that we are not petitioning that our System should be abolished. We are merely stating that it is in dire need of repair. This is a Declaration of Rights and a Petition, not a Declaration of Independence. We cannot stress this enough. We believe that the system as it was originally designed does work; that we can again be the envy of the modern world just as we once were. We have lost touch with ourselves and our Constitutional Foundations and are now politically paralyzed. We must reconnect with the Ideals that the United States was founded upon and we absolutely must do this before anything positive can occur. We see it as our hope by which we can save ourselves at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please allow us the liberty to preface our proposed detailed solution and plan for execution in terms that even a corporation or bank would understand. Any business that does not take regular inventory or does not do regular internal audits will eventually lose control of itself and self-destruct. To put it another way: poor self-management is the best recipe for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the same is true with government.  Therefore, we now propose an Exact Method by which we may exorcise every last one of the corruptions and usurpations that have occurred from within our realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- A Complete Inventory and Audit of Powers of all Federal Branches, Institutions, Procedures, Laws and Entitlements of our government should be taken and evaluated piecemeal in full view of the People.
-- All that are enumerated would then be checked for Constitutionality against the Federal Constitution.
-- All found to not be compatible can be given a notice of cease and desist or be granted a Constitutional Amendment by the States through the Amendment Procedure.
-- All that fail to gain an Amendment from the States would then be returned to the States themselves under the Tenth Amendment.
-- The States can then debate these items as a possible Amendment to their own individual State Constitutions, thus making them legal in their individual States.
-- In the case where each State does not ratify the proposed Amendment and if it is judged as incompatible with their Constitution and there is no other State Law preventing it, then the People can implement it if they so choose at the State or Local Levels via Law or Ordinance.
-- If that fails, then it wasn&amp;#39;t a power that the Government or the People should have assumed in the first place. It should then be regarded as fundamental in the interest of Liberty if there is no other Law preventing it.
-- During this process, anything enumerated specifically in the Constitution as unconstitutional or already prohibited by it (such as the Thirteenth Amendment prohibiting slavery) shall remain  inaccessible to implementation at any lower level. The Federal Constitution always retains priority over the States. State Constitutions always retain priority over Local Ordinances and Laws.
-- To prevent a reoccurrence of any future encroachments at the Federal level, an Amendment fully defining and clarifying both Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 (&amp;quot;The Necessary and Proper Clause&amp;quot;) and Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (&amp;quot;The Commerce Clause&amp;quot;) and any other ambiguous clauses should be debated by the States and ratified into the United States Constitution for the sake of clarity. The litmus test for that is a simple one. If any disagreement exists during the piecemeal review and evaluation, then they are enumerated and then subjected to further clarification or repeal using Amendment(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this process, Liberty is thus fully restored and then preserved and protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no case will these inventoried powers and institutions remain with the Federal government without a Constitutional Amendment that gives each of them full legitimacy or without a full verification of the preexisting intrinsic constitutionality of same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the overreaching power of the current Federal, State and Local governments can be rebalanced and placed firmly back under the scope of the Constitution. Powers improperly taken from the States can be returned or given back to the People. This also will realign the Constitution with all aspects of the corporate, financial, housing and banking systems automatically. It will also allow for all other issues from the People to be addressed in their rightful order and in due time. This re-enumeration of Powers rebalances the Federal government with itself, with the States and with the People resulting in a much needed sense of clarity. It will serve to stem the tide of corruption that has been infecting our government. With a Unified and Informed Nation, whole once again and working together again in the Spirit of True Discourse and with such a renewed Collective Spirit, there are no limits to what we can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that the best ideas are simple. We submit that this idea of realignment with our Constitution is the Cornerstone by which we may all reunite as One People and truly solve many of our Nation&amp;#39;s problems. We submit that for this Nation to continue to exist, we absolutely must take heed of and implement this proposal at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duly signed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SECTION II - Monitions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO OUR LEADERS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must wonder who among you could possibly take issue against an honest implementation of this proposal, save for those of you who would continue to profit from the status quo or would wish for a deliberate debasement of our way of life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realize that there are many among you who are just as concerned as we are. We also acknowledge  that many of you possibly may not have realized, while you were campaigning for office, just how pervasive and influential the &amp;quot;Special Interest Branch&amp;quot; truly is. Perhaps only after you were elected did you learn just how entrenched they really are? Perhaps this is why you have so readily abandoned your campaign promises to us so predictably?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these possibilities, surely we can offer you the temporary benefit of the doubt. But let us be clear: it is now up to you to decide our future opinions of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must immediately and publicly recommit to both the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; alike. In addition, you must declare that you will serve the recombined &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; equally and without partisan favor. You must reaffirm your oaths to uphold, preserve and protect the Constitution as well and above all else. You then must start to act like it. The opaque influence of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; must be made transparent and then equally balanced with transparent influences of our own. You may well continue to agree to disagree with each other as usual but you must temper your discourse and debate with a new sense of mutual respect and restraint at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you need to start doing your jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you forgotten that no matter your party affiliation, that once elected you are supposed to serve everyone equally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The age-old phrase, from fable, lyric and motto, that &amp;quot;United we stand, divided we fall&amp;quot; rings true to this day with the exact points that we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also cease your political infighting and cross the party lines that you have drawn that constrain you and strive to reach an accord with your brethren regardless of political party. You must do this in order to regain our trust and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can agree that there are radicals among us in the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; just as we can surely agree that there are radicals among you. Regardless, we both know that between us there lies a Voice of Reason. We hope that this New Common Sense proves that to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even reason demands that you should take heed of the following monition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hereby inform you that we will also be taking our own Inventory and Audit of all current and future representatives at all levels of government. The New Common Sense is but the start and we offer it to you as the First Fair Notice of only one way by which we will go about it.  Because we wish to support and will embrace only those who are willing to come forward to help repair this damage, we must identify you from where you stand. We certainly do not wish the continued mutilation and destruction of our beloved Constitutional Republic to continue. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We affirm that we wish to help repair our Nation in the true spirit of INTERDEPENDENCE. We demand that you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remind you that you are not the ones in charge. We are. This is a Nation of the People, by the People, for the People, remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to declare The New Common Sense to be extreme, then we declare that it must be true. After all, if a mere request that we recommit to obeying our own Constitution is extreme, then we&amp;#39;ve made our point, haven&amp;#39;t we. If, however, you choose to declare it as not extreme then it must also be true because then that means that we are right. You can&amp;#39;t win a propaganda war against us this time. We now have you in a corner and you surely must realize this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We the People have already chosen to rise above the fray. We have delivered to you this document, eschewed all opinions temporarily to open a discussion over some Simple Truths. We&amp;#39;ve boiled it down to one clear demand that no one who is a patriot could possibly disagree with: That the Constitution of the United States should be placed back at the &amp;quot;center&amp;quot; of active government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have so painstakingly pointed out, inventory of ourselves and the government from top to bottom should have been what we&amp;#39;ve been doing all along. Can anyone truly disagree with the idea of holding all that we are up to the Light of our Federal and State Constitutions? Could they object to this with a straight face? Can anyone who is a true patriot honestly say that they do not wish to rid our system of corruption, or level all playing fields once again, that they do not wish to obey and see enforced only the legal laws of this country? And most importantly: would they not wish for all involved to declare a new respect for our Constitution and would a patriot not wish to witness the process of repairing it back into the Living Document that is was designed to be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s but one more item of needful mention. Political attack ads need to cease. They are not constructive and will no longer help your cause. If you can find nothing good to say about yourselves then perhaps you shouldn&amp;#39;t be running for office. If you instead show respect for the other candidates and their ideas by refusing to run attack ads, then you will be sending us the message that you may be able to field diverse opinions and ideas. You will show us your ability to be flexible and will show us true Statesmanship. Attack ads only serve to inform us that you are not willing to compromise and thus not worthy of our vote. This type of politician we no longer need in office. So please, stop it if you wish to gain or keep your job. This tactic will no longer secure you any votes from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO THE CONGRESS IN SPECIFIC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That there are three basic levels of human societal structure. From least to most evolved, they are dependence, independence and interdependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We seem to be at odds because the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; appears to want to force us into the lowest state of dependence with your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Nation, however, was founded via The Declaration of Independence which was then followed by a social contract (The Constitution) that guaranteed that we would all participate in a society based solely on interdependence. The &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; has broken that contract with us in league with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dependence is not an option for We the People, for we would have to give up the freedoms and liberties that our hard won, hard kept and wholly cherished interdependence grants us. We simply are not willing to endure a forced state of dependence and our continued interdependence is the only option that we will accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear: if you want Unity with the People again it can only be accomplished at the level of interdependence. If you wish to continue to try to force unwarranted dependence upon us, with or without the aid of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;, then we shall continue our petitions for redress under the protections of the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also declare your independence from the influence of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;. You must protect yourselves from their attempts to also make you dependent on their money. You must find your own interdependence with each other, again, and with the Whole of the People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO THE MEDIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you try to analyze The New Common Sense in an attempt to label it as politically slanted or discount it as extremist rhetoric, let us state that this message is by its design well beyond the bounds of political partisanship. Otherwise, it will not stand up to the &amp;quot;divisive for the sake of being divisive&amp;quot; political scrutiny that we all bear daily witness to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realize that you may also attempt to lambast or ridicule the language and carried tone that we used in this missive as a strategy of your scrutiny. You may have noticed that the document begins in a more &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; language style and then proceeds to slowly change its language, punctuation and overall tone into a modern one as it progresses, becoming almost informal and overtly personal towards the end. This was by design. It was our intention to begin the document in the same tone as (as well as to borrow liberally some of the language of) various historical documents and then to slowly modernize this tone as we ultimately connect it firmly to the now. In addition, the nonstandard use of capitals is a way for us to retain emphasis in a document that in some forms may be distributed as plain text and without formatting. This technique has been used before by writers greater than we (including the composer(s) of the Declaration of Independence) so we cannot apologize for it. It, too, was deliberate. We hope that this explanation of some of our grammatical intentions help to clear up what you may consider to be unintended inconsistencies and that it removes an opportunity for you to criticize it on its face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let there be no doubt about this: the political system in this country is fundamentally broken and no amount of political rhetoric and slanted &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; opinions broadcast to the public by which you can fix a broken political system. Therefore, the only true answer to the Problem must come from a source that is not only above and beyond politics, but it must also be a solution that can include the voluntary input of literally everyone who would bear the equal burden of responsibility in implementing it. That includes you. You must return to a state of genuine balance in your reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Common Sense asks only for our government to -- Immediately reject what we term &amp;quot;The Special Interest Branch&amp;quot; and kick them out of backroom politics. -- Put laws in place giving equal voice to  anyone who wishes to speak regardless of their financial status. -- Respect and uphold the laws that are constitutional and abolish and/or correct those that are not. -- Take an inventory of all agencies and branches of government, using the Constitution, and only the Constitution, as the de-facto guide with which to go by.  -- Recommit to the Constitution as the first word on the boundaries of government. -- Reduce the ability for anyone to (mis)interpret the Constitution so broadly by discussing and then passing Amendments which will serve to clarify and modernize it. -- Restore to the People a transparent, open and fair election system nationwide that allows for a full accounting by the people of all elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It asks for nothing more. Do not try to read further into it. We&amp;#39;re tired of your spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want our respect then show us that you have the courage and honesty to speak out in favor of this proposal&amp;#39;s existence, even if you disagree with it as a matter of corporate mass media policy.  Help us promote The New Common Sense for the good of the Nation. Offer time and space for its discussion and open yourselves to all ideas that may stem from it and give it a platform. This is a unique chance for you to prove to us that at least you are not promoting imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of clarity, please let us remind you of something of which you surely are already aware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in history, technology has given us all a level playing field in terms of our ability to share information and communicate. We know that this must scare you. We know that, even apart from mere greed, this is most likely why the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; have instigated such an insane power grab in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we ask almost rhetorically, &amp;quot;What will prevent The New Common Sense from being ridiculed or simply ignored?&amp;quot; We protest, for example, to remind the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; that while they may have the largest share of the wealth, we, the People retain control of most of the other numbers. While the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; controls the mass media, we have the internet, social media and each other in great numbers. The &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; can no longer silence us with mere money, for they (in this case, by &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; we mean those who speak through you and reward you for your performance with a paycheck) no longer have a monopoly on the distribution of information to the masses with which they have attempted to manipulate us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the moment in history is upon us where we finally have the tools with which we can level the playing field with you. We can accomplish these goals with or without you. You see, we&amp;#39;re not buying your disinformation anymore, thus it&amp;#39;s time for you to have a real and serious dialog with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the internet and our growing awareness, the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; can no longer operate in the shadows. We shall expose their greed and mockery of our way of life through our protests. our collective voice, our individual efforts, all guided by the Light of this Declaration and with this New Common Sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, the roaches scatter when a light is shined on them, do they not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filters that the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; have attempted to install on reality, we can now remove. The New Common Sense itself stands as proof of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have asked us where we stand. You have asked us what we want. We have now given you your first detailed answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to change the conversation, will you not agree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a monition for you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will no longer believe your &amp;quot;anonymous sources,&amp;quot; your &amp;quot;unnamed insiders,&amp;quot; your unverified &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; nor do we care for your unsolicited opinions. You can stop telling us what to think and save from extinction the legacy of the media just reporting the facts. Believe it or not, we are fully capable of drawing our own conclusions and do not need your help in that regard. The very existence of this New Common Sense proves that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demand complete media transparency. We want accountability in our media and demand that you always declare your sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you may mock The New Common Sense and/or this monition at your peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DOMESTIC MILITIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are part of the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; too. Thus, we realize that you must be victims in this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please stand with us. We wish for nothing more than for you to join us in solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your badges we have no monition. We have only a request plea for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hereby recommit to obey the law as we seek our redress and we respectfully ask that you enforce only the law as it pertains to us, without preventing our right to peaceful assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we should have no conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO THE &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We certainly do not define you as the whole of the affluent 1% based upon your portfolio and assets. We define you as the affluent who use your wealth to gain self-serving leverage over government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that you are merely following human nature. We know that you have justified as good the things that you do. We are aware that our own apathy has contributed to this situation that we all find ourselves in today. We can even admit that given the opportunity, we might have done some of the same things you&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, who doesn&amp;#39;t want more wealth? It&amp;#39;s the American Dream after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the rift between us has become too wide. You have become too consumed by greed. Do you see all of this as a game? Are you addicted to Wall Street in the same way a gambler is addicted to the casino? Cannot you even see that ultimately you will destroy our way of life, yours included, with your greed and lust for power? And do you not realize that by destroying the Middle Class you are actually eliminating your main source of income?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The games that you insist on playing with our society will ultimately become your own ruin. Destroy our economy and you destroy yourselves with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you not feel it? Do you not realize that time is running out? Don&amp;#39;t you know that it might be &amp;quot;game over&amp;quot; soon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may feel that in this race against time, that you must &amp;quot;lock us down&amp;quot; and control us. You urge the government to violate our privacies and attempt to scare us with propaganda churned out by your various mass media machines. You try to silence our collective voice, pollute our conscience as if it were the environment itself and divert our attention in the hopes that we may waste time arguing with ourselves and never realize what you are up to. But we are on to you now. We have found a new common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower and lower you do sink, not even realizing that we are all in the same boat. We have news for you. We&amp;#39;re going to occupy your life raft too if this continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where we stand in protest. we see your problem as this: Your money cannot buy Truth and this is the lesson that you must learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is your Achilles&amp;#39; heel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you must have realized that this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;Declaration&amp;quot; at all, but that it is actually an edict. We the People are the rightful holders of true Power in this Nation, shared equally with all, including you, even though we know that you probably do not see it that way. The Truth is the Truth and we are in possession of It now. Your money can only buy you more lies and a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We absolutely do not wish for a &amp;quot;class war&amp;quot; between us. You need to understand, however, that we are quite serious. We&amp;#39;re not asking. Stop your corruptions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your monition is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not judge The New Common Sense unfairly and do not attack it. Work with us. Show us proof that you are willing to clean up your act and we shall work with you and for you. Police yourselves and reign in your greed. If you truly want to save this Nation then stop gaming this broken system for your own ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If after reading this missive you dare still hold the opinion that we are &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;, then by all means, allow the sheep to give you a message: No longer may you force us to consume the defecation that you call grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO THE &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By its design The New Common Sense is nothing more than a &amp;quot;voice of reason&amp;quot; that is designed to be compatible with all other past, present and future voices. It was crafted by persons just like you in a true spirit of cooperation and in the hopes that it will serve as a tool by which we can be further unified. It is our hope that it will aid in the start of a new dialog with the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; who, by reading this also, will hopefully realize that it&amp;#39;s time for them to listen and engage us with respect. It also points out, explains and offers a fully detailed and workable solution to the real core problem that affects us all. It then petitions the simple request for all of us to work together to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that this is an &amp;quot;infiltration&amp;quot; of some sort, then please read it again. We believe that it speaks for itself .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Common Sense was crafted to be above and beyond our individual issues, yet it still includes them &amp;quot;under its umbrella&amp;quot; as it shows how we can have our individual issues ultimately addressed. It makes the argument that we first have a serious problem to fix in government before anything else can matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it a &amp;quot;first word&amp;quot; on our common plight, but surely not the last. We believe that this is what makes it so special. It&amp;#39;s not combative by nature yet it is firm in its demands and explicit in its proposal. It deliberately avoids specific issues that do not directly support the main thesis. It&amp;#39;s merely honest and forthright in its tone. It is also designed to breed inspiration and is meant to be used as a starting point upon which you are all encouraged to follow up on with your own forms of public discourse going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please embrace The New Common Sense fully and help distribute it as fast and as far as you can! If this so much as touches your hands or crosses your eyes then it is critical that you must help distribute it immediately. If you can afford to print copies, please do so. If you can upload it and share, please do so. If you can tell others about this or share links to it, please do so. An &amp;quot;audio book&amp;quot; version is also being released for the benefit of the blind (who are of course part of the 99%, too!) and distributed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each and every one of us must stand together and treat all ideas such as this with the utmost of  importance. We must act now! If we show apathy or delay then we may lose our opportunity to help instigate true change and we may never have another chance to be heard. Don&amp;#39;t think for a minute that the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t plotting and scheming for a way to prevent us from being able to speak out like this again. If we show any weakness at this point, if we make the same mistakes that other failed movements have made (such as by not staying decentralized or by choosing sides on issues instead of standing together against a problem-- BIG difference!), if we don&amp;#39;t act now and unite, then we may lose what could be our last chance to ever right these wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author(s) have decided to remain anonymous in order for this to stand as a true gift to the masses. All ego has thus been removed as there is now no personal credit to be had. However, there is another reason that is not so altruistic that we must be honest about. We are also anonymous for our own protection. The &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; is playing hard ball. They might go to great lengths to make sure that Truths like this do not see the light of day. Therefore we do it as a protection for all of us. We also do it to keep them guessing, right out of the Sun Tzu playbook. For all they know, this could have come from anywhere, even from their own back yard. This is to our advantage (because it very well might be true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in order to protect this document, an insurance file has been made that can be opened only by the actual author(s) and it is also being distributed. In the unforeseen case that the document should ever become corrupted and it becomes necessary to prove the source of the original (or the actual text of the original itself if it becomes diluted or corrupted), then we will be able to do so. The insurance file also allows us to release true updates for this if they are ever needed and allows us to prove source because we can then release the old insurance password to prove that since only we could know it while providing a new one for the update which would replace it. In this way, you can be sure that it came from the same source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see this insurance file, please download it and copy it. Please distribute it also. It is the only thing that stands between this message and its destruction. It is what will allow this to stay whole long enough to distribute without being infiltrated and diluted (or worse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An MD5 sum (a sort of &amp;quot;serial number&amp;quot; generated from the data of a file that can be used as a way to insure that a file hasn&amp;#39;t been modified, please Google it if you&amp;#39;d like to learn more about it and do not know what it is) is also included in the insurance file so that anyone can check and verify that the digital release of this document is in fact the original, since the MD5 sum will change if it was altered in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a necessary word about copyright. While this document is being given freely to the public domain without any duplication or distribution restrictions so long as they remain non-profit, the copyright is being reserved and all modifications are discouraged as another means of a protection from those who may wish to modify it with the intention to dilute and/or discredit it. So please make no changes to this? Just pass it on, if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we say that there is no credit to be had for this? Well, we misspoke. The credit belongs to you! Since this document was originally gifted to our minds through the process of carefully collecting public opinion, it really does come from you, the &amp;quot;collective conscience&amp;quot; that is mentioned at the very beginning. We merely collected the ideas that we found to be most popular and attempted to put them into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go ahead, take the credit, you&amp;#39;ve earned it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May we digress for a moment and inject a few personal notes? This was originally written with the intent for it to be nothing more than a simple Declaration. It had the working title of &amp;quot;A New Declaration of Interdependence&amp;quot;. Only when it was completed and fully edited did we see it as a whole and realize that we may have actually achieved something beyond just that. In fact, we received a great surprise when we compared it to the classic historical treatise by Thomas Paine, known as &amp;quot;Common Sense&amp;quot; (published in 1776 and yet completely out of our minds during the period that we crafted this). When we compared it, we noticed that it too was written with the exact same intentions as ours and that we have indeed achieved a document that we believe is at nearly the same level. Hence, it became obvious that this should be given the title of The New Common Sense. We can only hope that it has the same impact of the original. W can make no apology for its length. It needed to be complete and unabridged because there is no time to do this piecemeal. We wish we could have made it shorter, but we truly believe that everything in it had to be said. Therefore, we worked hard on it up front to make it as thorough and as complete as possible so that it can be catapulted as is into the public discussion, and fast! Oh, and &amp;quot;Common Sense&amp;quot; was much longer than this even if we include the monitions section when we compare size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you can easily and immediately help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By affixing a signature, you may convert The New Common Sense into a letter and make it your own. Send it to your congressmen, the media, to friends and family, to corporations. Send it to anyone and everyone that you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By collecting signatures, you may transform it into a petition. You can even combine it with others who have done the same and create larger petitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working together to distribute The New Common Sense to the &amp;quot;99%&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; alike, we will turn this into a unifying movement and change the course of history!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, don&amp;#39;t allow The New Common Sense to be in vain. Sign it, own it, send it, copy it. Please help spread it far and wide, as fast as possible. We have no more time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets &amp;quot;Occupy The Constitution!&amp;quot; And may we receive our Due Justice and see a speedy and peaceful return to the Constitutional Republic that we were supposed to inherit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A space for signature(s) is placed at the bottom of the &amp;quot;Our Petition&amp;quot; chapter. We hope that by now you have already seen it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck! Thank you for embracing and sharing The New Common Sense in advance, and may we all further unite and take our country back as One (but without the percent, unless they shape up of course)!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ending Corporate Personhood in California - Making it Happen</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming challenge of ending corporate personhood is this:  How do we get people who are bought and paid for by corporations to bite the hand that feeds them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer -- and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to meeting with you to have a discussion about other ideas -- is to show them that if they don&amp;#39;t bite the hand that feeds them, the hands that pull the voting levers will pick someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practical matter, it seems to me this boils down to having at least one fairly committed activist in each State Assembly district, State Senate district, and U.S. Congressional district who is willing to work toward the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out by phone, mail, or best yet, by personal meeting whether their state or federal representatives will support one of the many proposals in the House of Representatives to eliminate corporate personhood. (for example, the proposals of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jimmcgovern.com/corporatepersonhood/&quot;&gt;Jim McGovern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://teddeutch.house.gov/UploadedFiles/DEUTCH_036_xml.pdf&quot;&gt;Ted Deutch&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6cehXA5mHo&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;Donna Edwards&lt;/a&gt; (Co-sponsored by John Conyers and others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they will support it, finding out what we can do to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circulating petitions locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they won&amp;#39;t support it, get them to go on record, preferably with press cameras around, saying that they believe corporations are people, or refusing to say it and refusing to support a constitutional amendment AND / OR convince them that we will endorse their campaign and provide them with all the support we can if they will support it AND / OR having a press-covered meeting with them in which you present them with a petition with a substantial number of signatures of voters in their district (and then having them go on record one way or the other) AND /OR probing to find out what might make them change their mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following up to ensure that they do what they said they would and provide them with whatever help you offered, or publishing the fact that they didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinating with the press and local political organizations such as the Occupy Movement or the Tea Party who can help us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short time I&amp;#39;ll also start posting some meetup times -- probably we&amp;#39;ll do these by WebEx or a similar online service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to meet you and have a chance to talk to you very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Launching Californians Against Corporate Personhood</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I launched Californians Against Corporate Personhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who like success stories of big fights won by organizations with modest beginnings, you&amp;#39;re in the right place, because we&amp;#39;re as modest as it gets -- one guy, no budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are going to accomplish is a big fight, to be sure.  The process of amending the constitution to eliminate the idea of corporations as people is we need to accomplish is spelled out in Article 5 of the Constitution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already there are a number of organizations working on this on a national level, and part of what we&amp;#39;ll be doing is coordinating and cooperating with those that appear to have the best chance of moving the agenda forward.  My opinion so far is that this will turn out to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://unitedrepublic.org&quot;&gt;United Republic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#unitedrep&quot;&gt;@unitedrep&lt;/a&gt;) since among the organizations scrambling to put the energy unleashed by the occupy movement to good account, they seem to be the best organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help Cenk Uygur get organized I just wrote to him about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolf-pac.com/&quot;&gt;Wolf-Pac&lt;/a&gt; when he mentioned he needs an executive director.   Long-shot job application much?  Oh well, no balls no blue chips as the saying goes.  If I get hired as Wolf-Pac&amp;#39;s Executive Director, I&amp;#39;ll take back all that stuff I said about United Republic being more organized -- because I&amp;#39;ll make it not be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point in launching Californians Against Corporate Personhood is that it may turn out that the only way that I can make a significant contribution to this effort is to take it to the state level.  With three fourths of the states needed to ratify this and 2/3 of them needing to come on board either in Congress or at the State Legislatures just to get the party started, we&amp;#39;ll need a guy in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some next steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to organize the fragmented information that&amp;#39;s available online.  There are probably at least a dozen online petitions circulating by now, and not less than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_65/Advocacy-Groups-Seek-to-Curb-Corporations-210594-1.html?pos=hln&quot;&gt;three proposals&lt;/a&gt; by three different Democratic House members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start developing a committed group of activists in California who can work on offline petitions, meetings with state and federal representatives, and other forms of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start approaching Occupy Wall Street centers throughout California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on arguments and messages that will appeal to the right.  They need to see that crony capitalism is not free market capitalism, and the job creators they love so much need to spend their time creating jobs and not interfering with the people&amp;#39;s business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work respectfully and try to practice Gandhi-style ahisma (non-violence) with everyone I meet and work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please write to me about your views on this and contact me to volunteer.  Government of the people, by the people, and for the people has to start with the right definition of who the people are.  (Hint -- if you&amp;#39;re reading this, you are.  Your company isn&amp;#39;t, but your boss is.  It&amp;#39;s so simple it took the Supreme Court 200 years to fully screw it up).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Non-Violence Triggering The Spam Filter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently commented on the San Francisco Bay Guardian’s Online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbg.com/comment/reply/23181&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on Anonmyous targeting the police group that coordinated calls on the Occupy movement. Unfortunately that comment got trapped in the spam filter. Not sure why? What’s so spammy about peace love and understanding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s the comment for those of you who may find it interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what scares me more -- the police who may do a bad job of enforcing perhaps illegitimate limitations on the first amendment, or anonymous vigilantes encouraging mayhem against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to feel vengeful and to get behind groups like Anonymous as they out the police. To the extent that we do, however, we cease to be a movement with the moral power to persuade, and become nothing less than the very mob our opponents accuse us of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be firm in working for change. Be kind to one another (easy) -- and be kind to those on the other side who may have done nothing to deserve it (hard). If enough people do this, no one need fear signing our names to anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Non-Violence, Social Change, and the Occupy Movement</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The animosity between the two political parties is nothing new. Likewise violence and class exploitation have been with us for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Occupy Movement has been on the receiving end of a good deal of police violence – from Scott Olsen’s fractured skull. Any questions of a generation gap have been summarily answered by pepper spray, which falleth alike on eighty-four year old women and peaceful young adults at UC Davis (among many others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Occupy side, it seems a truism that the police are the perpetrators of this violence, but I do wonder sometimes if someone like Gandhi might have counseled less arm-locking and more willingly allowing oneself to be arrested. To me it seems like a really robust and consistently non-violent position means taking a certain pity on the police to the extent of trying to not put them in the position to inflict violence. Moreover the “multiplicity of methods” that Occupy advocates, though not intended by any means to endorse violence in any form, is not the sort of thing that necessarily enforces a rigid and disciplined non-violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give another example where non-violence might go further, does heckling political figures really advance the cause? Certainly it’s dramatic, but when I watch it happening it always looks strikes me as rude and counterproductive. This is equally true when people I would otherwise agree with are doing it as when it comes from members of the tea party. (Much as seeing this makes me uncomfortable, admittedly I’m at a loss to replace this method of gaining attention, since more genteel petition for redress seem so routinely doomed to be ignored).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my position as a very sympathetic but very part time member of the movement, such kibitzing may seem like armchair quarterbacking. I do think that speaking for me, studying Gandhi’s history and reading other writers on non-violence is a very interesting endeavor that I think will help to educate me as to the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My Response to Occupy Call for an Alternative Day of Action</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently left this idea on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.occupytogether.org/2011/11/19/call-for-an-alternative-day-of-action-on-human-rights-day-saturday-december-10th-2011/&quot;&gt;Call for an Alternative Day of Mass Action&lt;/a&gt; post on Occupy Together’s web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While signs and uniforms are interesting visuals that appeal to those who already agree with us, I think it would help grow the movement tremendously if we were always seen acting in Gandhian non-violence and love toward the poor and downtrodden whom we profess to care about. So, for example, carrying a sign -- OK. Carrying a sign (or not) while volunteering in a food kitchen or a free clinic -- awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with &amp;quot;we are the 99% and we want our student loans and mortgages forgiven&amp;quot; is that the portion of 99% who don&amp;#39;t yet agree with us (about 40-ish % at last count) can see through our thin anti-corporatism to find what they see in corporations underneath -- self-interested economic war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;ve waged class war on us all these years&amp;quot; -- though correct historically -- begs the question. Violence on their part returned by violence on ours diminishes us as individuals while it limits our growth as a movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniforms and signs and other advertising gimmicks are nothing that Corporations don&amp;#39;t already own in spades. Active and consistent acts of kindness and love toward those less fortunate than ourselves are things that will benefit us both personally and as a mass movement.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bringing the Occupy Movement and the Tea Party Together</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Tea Party members are mad because the government is not functioning right, and crony capitalism interferes with the free market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Occupy movement is mad because the government is not functioning right, and crony capitalism interferes with direct representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime, the non-functioning government and the businesses that are in bed with them are laughing all the way to the bank, as they watch the two sides fight it out among themselves. Like wolves in the hen house, they gorge themselves on our wealth while those of us who should be protecting the chickens are barking at each other and fighting over scraps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our anonymity on the Internet divides us more, allowing us to get a quick mental rush out of sniping at each other with tired clichés that we think represent the rich diversity of human beings in both movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the wolves win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my fellow members of the Occupy Movement, I say this: reaching out a hand of friendship to members of the Tea Party – collectively or individually – is an act of active non-violence that will move our agenda forward. It is a deeply spiritual act in the spirit of Gandhi, who said: &lt;em&gt;“Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our friends in the Tea Party, I say this: I know that many of the people on the right hold sincere and heartfelt religious convictions, and I offer my hand in friendship to all who would work toward the mutual benefit of our common humanity, in the spirit of Matthew 5:44, in which Jesus said, &lt;em&gt;“But I tell you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not need to minimize or ignore the fundamental and sincere differences we may have on matters of policy, but compared to the common threat we face from a government that represents neither of our interests, our differences are merely the excuses we make to ourselves for not having a better and more just society than the one we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You deserve better. We all deserve better. Together we can build something better, but we can’t build a house if we burn down one another’s walls as soon as they go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Abraham Lincoln (quoting Jesus) who said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less famously, it was a popular music group who sang in the 70s:     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For united we stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divided we fall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if our back should ever be against the wall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll be together, together you and I.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How Much Is Enough</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The cops arrived at dawn from fifteen jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They roused the terrible rabble (who they later charged with camping)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firing tear gas on men, women, and children&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest in crowd control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shot Scott Olsen in the head &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shot Scott Olsen in the head&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fractured his skull&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough cops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many Scott Olsens will get shot in the head for camping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Fox News lies about ACORN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support the troops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much will you believe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many jobs will you send overseas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cook your numbers this quarter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many black lies told by how many white men and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First black presidents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t tax the job creators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay no attention while we sign these trade agreements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia, South Korea, Panama&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your free trade isn’t free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t have protectionism without protecting something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could it be that isn’t free that you could be protecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody’s job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody you’ll shoot in the head&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for camping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of protecting his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much of our money&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will get robbed in the next election&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While FOX lies about ACORN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whle FOX lies about anti-semitism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While FOX lies in the stomach of America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like leftover food for fools left to rot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fat cats float flat tax&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you smug in your private community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you swung your nine irons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you pasted new phones on your loneliness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many processors do you need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a phone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To watch FOX lie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lie on your back or &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your teeth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or come, ye 99ers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the next how many rallies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to be shot in how many heads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by how many cops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from how many jurisdictions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun is rising&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On America shot in the face&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun is rising too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because we’re here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in solidarity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;asking &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how much is enough?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>In Solidarity with Occupy Wall Street</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://occupywallst.org/&quot;&gt;Occupy Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; with great interest on Twitter, and last Saturday Jenniffer and I went down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/occupytogether/Sacramento-CA/&quot;&gt;Occupy Sacramento&lt;/a&gt; for a time to meet the folks and show our support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Occupy Wall Street finally makes it worthwhile to be on Twitter, I thought it was time to write a little more than 140 characters about what a wonderful thing the movement is and how much I enjoyed my brief time meeting with the folks in Sacramento.  To be honest, it&amp;#39;s hard to put into words what a wonderful feeling it was to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Bush era, I was positively embarrassed to be an American.  When the bailouts came in 2008, I left the real estate business I&amp;#39;d been building for several years to go back to work as a computer programmer.   I remember hearing about statistics that went something like this (sorry if this is a bit imprecise, but it&amp;#39;s from memory):   Of 2,000 calls to one of our California Senators (I forget which one), all but six of them were opposed to the bailout.  So public opposition was something like 99.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senator voted for the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any illusions about our government being &amp;quot;representative&amp;quot; that I might have been foolish enough to hold onto before that time were shattered by that news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Occupy Wall Street came along, I had no idea what to do about it.  Moreover, I certainly wasn&amp;#39;t trying, because I didn&amp;#39;t even think anyone &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am full of hope for the future, and respect for the people of this movement.  They have shown me that there is something that I can do -- that we all can do.  They have reminded me of the words of the Declaration of Independence, that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hereby withdraw my consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we on the eve of a second American Revolution?  Who can say?  I for one don&amp;#39;t think the corporate state will give up its prerogatives willingly, but perhaps I underestimate the power of non-violent movements to wield influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I know where all of this will end up.  But for the first time in my memory I believe the answer might be something other than hell-in-a-hand-basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay strong.  I love you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Design and Being in a State of Flow</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For someone who considers himself skeptical and rational, I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of self help books.  Naturally, given my skeptical and rational bent, my taste in such books leans heavily toward those that either really are somewhat scientific or at least make a pretense of being that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve been reading Daniel Goleman&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Emotional%20Intelligence&amp;amp;tag=sacramentorea-20&amp;amp;index=aps&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&quot;&gt;Emotional Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, which is the kind of intelligence I don&amp;#39;t have as much of.  I have a good supply of the other kind, according to such measures as the Stanford/Binet IQ test and the SATs.  But as regards Emotional Intelligence, I rank somewhere between &amp;quot;average at best&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hopelessly out of control&amp;quot;, depending on what test I take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test that predicts I&amp;#39;m hopelessly out of control suggests as possible &amp;quot;favored careers&amp;quot; such possibilities as psychotherapist, philosophy professor, or web designer.  Among careers that are disfavored are fighter pilot and construction manager.  Interestingly enough, being a CEO is both favored and disfavored for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication is that if you&amp;#39;re a bit of a kook, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be flying planes or building buildings, but it&amp;#39;s OK to mess with people&amp;#39;s heads or build web sites, and no one is sure if you should be running a company.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Howard Hughes kept the door open for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortunately, Web Design is On The List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to find out that Web Design was on the list of acceptable professions for unacceptable people, since I really like doing it so much, and often find that I can work on a site for many hours at a time while becoming completely engrossed in what I&amp;#39;m doing, a state that Michael Csikszentmihalyi wrote about in yet another self-help book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Flow&amp;amp;tag=sacramentorea-20&amp;amp;index=aps&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&quot;&gt;Flow:  The Psychology of Optimal Experience&lt;/a&gt;.  Of all the web sites I&amp;#39;ve built, only a few have actually paid me, and if you work out the hourly rate and compare it to my day job as a programmer, it turns out that not being creative actually pays a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that if my day job were to become web design, I&amp;#39;d have to develop systems and repetitive product offerings so I could make a decent living at it.  In other words, I&amp;#39;d have to treat it more &amp;quot;practically&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the personality testers would make of that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>CSS3 and Modern Web Design Resources This WeekRecursos Para CSS y Diseño Web Moderno Esta Semana</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been preparing for a tutorial series that I will write soon that will start with a blank screen in a text editor and finish with a complete modern CSS3 web site layout.  I might also include a bilingual Wordpress and / or Drupal theme, depending on how ambitious I&amp;#39;m feeling once I&amp;#39;m well into it.  In preparation, I&amp;#39;ve been perusing several websites to think about what sorts of things I would like to include. I&amp;#39;ll post a follow-up to this article outlining the work we&amp;#39;ll be doing in the tutorial, but meantime, I thought I&amp;#39;d share some of the resources I found, which are excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Can Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we’ll want to provide for is the ability to grow the site to an indefinite size, and one key element to supporting this is a nested navbar menu.  Coding these without breaking something used  to be a major project, but JQuery and (to a lesser extent CSS3) have simplified things tremendously.  For a basic tutorial with starter code, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/danwellman&quot;&gt;Dan Wellman&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-create-a-drop-down-nav-menu-with-html5-css3-and-jquery/&quot;&gt;How to Create a Drop-down Nav Menu with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery&lt;/a&gt;.   You can find several more tutorials and lots of good ideas for how one might implement drop downs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/1stwebdesigner&quot;&gt;1stWebDesigner&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/b7VqWi&quot;&gt;38 jQuery And CSS Drop Down Multi Level Menu Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.  Time sink warning:  it’s hard to pick a favorite among the articles he highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we’ll also want rounded corners and CSS3 gradients.  Is it the most universally compatible solution that will work on every browser?  Of course not, but it should degrade well, and one of our goals in the article series will be to excercies our flabby CSS muscles a bit.  A starting point for these is Schillmania&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2009/css3-and-the-future/&quot;&gt;CSS 3 and The Future: Image-free Rounded Corners, Drop Shadows and Gradients&lt;/a&gt;.  Finally, we may have to throw in a little pure CSS eye candy, such as those you can find in &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/film_girl&quot;&gt;Christina Warren&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/06/04/awesome-css3-techniques/&quot;&gt;7 Awesome CSS3 Techniques You Can Start Using Right Now&lt;/a&gt;.  I want bubble quotes, so my monthly non-spam comment will look really, really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Need at the Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh my gosh, I can’t believe I’ve developed a real taste for Earl Gray Tea.  My life as a geek is complete if I can say that the first thing we’ll need at the keyboard is “Tea, Earl Gray, Hot”.  One other item that I’m sure will prove equally nice to have around as time goes by is SmashingMagazine&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;Cascading Style Sheets Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;.   Another useful starting point if you&amp;#39;re a beginning student (or like me, a half-baked intermediate student) of CSS is their introduction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/05/mastering-css-coding-getting-started/&quot;&gt;Mastering CSS Coding, Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a discouraging, really.  Wanting to write an article series on an Internet that includes SmashingMagazine.com is like trying to be a playwright when you live accross the street from William Shakespeare.  Might as well just hyperlink to Othello and call it a day.  But perhaps you&amp;#39;ll find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo siento, pero este artículo aun no está traducido desde inglés.  ¿Que puedo decir?  Trabajo demasiado durante la semana, porque me pagan.  Les prometo que voy a traducirlo pronto.  Gracias por tu paciencia.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My First Bilingual Web SiteMi Primer Sitio Web Bilingüe</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days I have been working on adding support for bilingual blogging to ParticleWave.com.  Today I am very happy to be writing my first bilingual article.  For this first article, I am writing the the translation into Spanish by myself -- just ask any native Spanish speaker!  I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ve left one or two errors in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/es/2010/06/12/my-first-bilingual-web-site/&quot;&gt;Spanish version&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe I can ask one of my friends to clean it up a little for me.  Oh, by the way, in case you missed it, the links to switch between languages are located at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using a Wordpress plugin called QTranslate, and for the most part I think it works very well.  I had to fix one bug, however.  qtranslate&lt;em&gt;core.php was setting a cookie at a time after the headers had been sent for the page.  I discovered that the cookie wasn&amp;#39;t needed, so I simply removed it.  Another source of confusion at first was the idea that I had to use theme widgets in order to install the links to change languages.  Then I discovered the function &amp;quot;qtrans&lt;/em&gt;generateLanguageSelectCode&amp;quot;, which generates the HTML for the links as an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this plugin works extremely well, making it extremely easy to write in both languages at once (or to write one version and have a translator provide the other later).  One issue that I found since I installed this plugin in an existing site is that, of course, I now have a ton of links in English that point to pages in Spanish that say, in effect, &amp;quot;Sorry, but this version isn&amp;#39;t available in Spanish&amp;quot; and pointing back to the English.  As time goes by and I add more content, I believe this issue will take care of itself.Los últimos días he añadido un soporte para escribir en español e inglés en ParticleWave.com.  Hoy me alegra mucho escribir mi primer artículo bilingüe. Para este primer artículo, estoy haciendo la traducción hacia español por mí mismo -- ¡solo pregúntale a alguien que sea hablante nativo de español! Estoy seguro que hay uno o dos errores en la versión en español, pero quizás puedo pedir a un amigo limpiarlo un poquito para mí. A propósito, los enlaces para cambiar el idioma quedan arriba en la  página, por si no los encuentra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estoy usando un &amp;quot;plug-in&amp;quot; de Wordpress que se llama QTranslate, y  generalmente creo que funciona bien. Sin embargo, he tenido que reparar un “bug”. Qtranslate&lt;em&gt;core.cpp instalaba un &amp;quot;cookie&amp;quot; un tiempo después de que se envían los encabezados de la página.  Lo que encontré fue que este &amp;quot;cookie&amp;quot; no se necesita, así que simplemente la removí. Al inicio, otra fuente de confusión fue la idea de que tenía que usar los &amp;quot;widgets&amp;quot; de las temas para instalar los enlaces que cambian el idioma.  Entonces descubrí la función &amp;quot;qtrans&lt;/em&gt;generateLanguageSelectCode&amp;quot;, que genera el HTML para los enlaces en forma de una lista sin ordenar (&lt;ul&gt;).
Por encima de todo, este &amp;quot;plug-in&amp;quot; funciona muy bien haciendo fácil escribir en ambos idiomas al mismo tiempo. Alternativamente se puede llevar la versión escrita a un traductor experto. Por supuesto, un problema pequeño que encontré desde que instalé este &amp;quot;plug-in&amp;quot; es que ahora tengo muchísimos enlaces en inglés que llevan hacia páginas en español que dicen &amp;quot;Disculpa, pero esta entrada está disponible sólo en &amp;quot;English&amp;quot; y que apuntan de vuelta a la versión en Inglés. Conforme pasa el tiempo y añado más contenido, creo que esta cuestión se resolverá por sí misma.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Role Models - Spending Time in the Design Phase of My Life</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;When people are free to do as they please, the usually imitate each other.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-- Eric Hoffer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I wrote about finding my life’s purpose, and since then I’ve spent more time reading el señor optimista, Anthony Robbins, and working through some of his exercises. As with many self-help books, there comes a point where you list your goals, and the author starts with great ideas like making millions and flying private jets. By this point, I usually feel compelled to write something in the millions, but I must say, I’ve had difficulty in the past tying this goal to my values, since I don’t think that wealth _per se _is really high on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing values, of course, is yet another Tony Robbins exercise, along with going on a mental diet. Yes, I am currently on one, on day two, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t listed my values yet. I think it might be helpful to do so in the context of first writing about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Missing Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this exercise is missing from Tony Robbins’ book, or maybe I skipped over it, but because I consider myself to be in the design phase of my life and my future business, I am going to list some role models for my business. These are possible prototypes, or approaches to designing a set of business goals that are consistent with my values. I should point out that though it’s missing in my reading to date, the exercise is implicit in Tony’s ongoing study of successful people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here without further ado are several role models I am looking at, for one reason or another. I suspect the goal that I fashion once the design phase is finished and I move on to implementation will be a mixture of one or more of these approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tony Robbins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, if it’s not obvious already, this Tony Robbins is having an impact on me. Yes, I know, he does fire walking at his seminars. Nobody’s perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37 Signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Legend (or their book) has it that these eight or so developers have generated a huge amount of cash for themselves, some $24.00 per month of which came from my real estate business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramento-home.com&quot;&gt;Elite Properties&lt;/a&gt;. The model here is to write several simple but elegant Application Service Provider applications in Ruby on Rails. Great model. Great language. What a hoot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Service Providers in General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s unfortunate that Microsoft’s Active Server Pages has the same acronym as Application Service Providers, because as role models go, ASP is not one of them. ASP is just some technology that one may or may not highlight on a resume. In this article, ASP stands for Application Service Providers (which are genuinely exciting as a business model) not Active Server Pages (which at best are interesting). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Producer and SettlementRoom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Top Producer began as a desktop application (or perhaps pre-desktop), devoted to helping Realtors® manage their business. Their application itself was uselessly ponderous as of the last time I tried it, which often happens with fat clients hastily ported to the web. As far as I know Settlement began as an ASP providing escrow management. One idea on which I worked part time for several weeks was an application which split the difference between these two real estate applications, while trying to emulate the simplicity of 37 Signals apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICanLocalize.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These folks provide general localization and translation services, a model which appeals to my new-found passion for languages. They combine this with web site design and development in Drupal and Wordpress. How cool is that? For you, maybe not at all. For me, &lt;em&gt;¡es muy chevere!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hulihan Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I just found this site today, and was impressed by the owner’s approach of creating several lightweight Common License applications, apparently to serve as the loss leader to his web development and design business. This is another Ruby on Rails shop, but the service oriented, open source approach here is very, very different from that of 37 Signals. The choices the author made for applications was also of interest, as was seeing them in use on his site and thinking about how one might design something similar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/11/01/knee-jerk-open-source-ialism/&quot;&gt;employee owned software company&lt;/a&gt; back in November. An employee owned company is great if you place a high value on contributing to the success of others within your organization, or if you watch too many Michael Moore movies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Questions for the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV4cgs-bPic&quot;&gt;the Warriors&lt;/a&gt;? There must be some word! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do my choices of attractive companies tell me about my values? What can I learn by listing my favorites? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I use this to design a more exciting plan? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can any shorter term goals be generated from these exercises? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>The Unimaginable</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the profound mystery of my prolonged respiration, my life is full of lesser curiosities. For example, I’ve been using Twitter lately. In this respect I’m like one fine episode of Gilligan’s Island, in which in one scene Gilligan resists wearing a dress thus: “You can’t make me, you can’t make me, you can’t make me.”&amp;quot; Of course in the next scene Gilligan is wearing a dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now donned Twitter, and yes, I agree: it looks as ridiculous on me as Gilligan’s Dress. I’m at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/JohnLockwood&quot;&gt;@JohnLockwood&lt;/a&gt;. Say hello, it would be a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still more unusual than using Twitter is this: I follow Tony Robbins. You all know Tony Robbins, pop psychology’s answer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=L01&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;q=Guy+Smiley&amp;amp;btnG=Search&quot;&gt;Guy Smiley&lt;/a&gt;. I’m interested in what he has to say. Through the usual means of Google, learn, hyperlink, repeat, I learned a little more about Neurolinguistic Programming by looking at some pages about Robbins. It’s interesting too. I’ll probably buy a book or two about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That much is not unusual: I’ll probably buy a book or two. What can I say, I’m an intellectual, and intellectuals buy books. Amazon.com eyes me with the very lust that the lion has for a slow zebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big oddity of my forties was leaving software development to pursue a career in sales. Of course in recent years, temperament and the economy have conspired to return me to my earlier craft, and so – much like angular momentum – nerdhood would appear to be conserved. A bigger surprise awaited me in finding out that I’d not only find a a regular W2 job with the 8 to 5 and the cubicle and the donuts on Friday, but actually, in some measure, enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day job notwithstanding, I have not yet abandoned my quest for the most unimaginable thing of all: my life’s calling. In this case, by unimaginable I mean something quite literal: if I have a life’s calling, I can’t imagine what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely convinced that having a life’s calling is not something that motivational types like Tony Robbins haven’t made up to sell books about how to find it, secure in the knowledge that most people pass their lives as I do: more or less farting around. Selling houses is a good business model because they’re expensive, but a lot more people have houses than a clearly defined sense of what their purpose in life is. So on the demand side, selling the idea of finding oneself is not a bad way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to spend some time finding myself. If I succeed, I’ll let you know where I was all along. I’ll bring a water bottle in case I appear to be dehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Facebook Privacy Concerns</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Lately the well publicized quitting of Facebook by many Google empoyees and others over privacy issues has struck me as rather funny. OK, exactly what state secrets do you have on Facebook that would be a huge problem if someone found out? You like the movie Avatar? You play basketball? Yep, I could get your bank account information easily with that data. Your name? Make one up if you&amp;#39;re paranoid. Your birthday? Likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look: the whole point of a web site like Facebook is to share a bunch of meaningless details with friends and people for whom the bar to being your friend is their desire to have a high number of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Saturday Morning With The Dog vs. Twitter and Facebook</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Word of warning: this isn’t going to be a fair fight at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship I have with my dog on a walk is tremendously satisfying. In the first place, she loves it. There’s no opportunity in a a typical day to give another being as much joy as I can give my dog simply by finding the leash and walking out the door. Then there’s the loyalty: on the leash, my dog wants to wander off, and on it she wants to pull a bit. But for all that, she’s always amenable to being called back to be by my side, and with the exception of cats and squirrels, which must be chased, her attention is generally squarely on me, which assuages my megalomania. And recently she even stopped on command and refrained from chasing a cat. Remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is good for 30-60 minutes or so, during which I’m moving, my heart is beating, lungs are filling with air, and the cold mornings of a planet on the brink of another ice age are very invigorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Twitter and Facebook. My basic routine is shaping up to look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Tweetdeck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scan messages for something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm, slim pickings. Well, Purva’s awake. Say something dumb to Purva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read a real estate post or two by a prodigious blogger pal. Hmm, loan fraud is always something buyers commit, not lenders. Consider an article with an ant-capitalist morale. Realize it won’t fit in 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for another interesting post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply to Jeffo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write an article about my dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the Tweetdeck refresh button, anything interesting now? OK, fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then of course, I finish getting dressed. Now where was that leash?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Confessions of a Social Media Retard Moron</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been really trying to blog more and Twitter more and FaceBook more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why yet. I thnk I might be selling something someday, but I’m not sure what. This is probably how people should sell on social media, rather gently. There’s a company near here that I added to my friends on Twitter, because they asked an interesting question or two about the area, and their first response was to send me a private message with “How can we help you with your [company business related] needs?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you can’t, really, I was just saying hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, I noticed that Jay Thompson has thousands of followers. That guy is everywhere. And he doesn’t sell, but if I had a referral I’d give it to him, because I know who he is. He’s very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the non-business side of the spectrum we have Purva Brown. Purva just enjoys Facebook and talks about what she likes to talk about, and has a good time. I admire that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m trying hard to feel my way around the whole Web 2.0 phenomenon, the core problem I have is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As often as not, I have nothing (or very little) to say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a really hard time just going out there and saying nothing, because people who update me on the kind of trivial details that I generally have in stock bore the daylights out of me, and I don’t want to inflict that on others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t take a lot of pictures. I don’t know why. I have a nice camera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think to be really successful at social media, you have to be just confident enough in yourself to blab at the mouth a lot, yet not so egotistical that you feel the need to have something to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Social Networking, Are You Kidding Me?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, leave it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrewrhee.net/&quot;&gt;Andrew Rhee&lt;/a&gt;, my very smart friend, to finally teach me what social network marketing is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I had in understanding social network marketing was that when I first encountered it, it was as a Realtor, and most of my colleagues were just setting up pages like “Podunk Real Estate” and asking me to be fans. This struck me as rather self serving and not very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew straightened me out the other day by telling me that he rarely goes on Google except to find information, but when a friend recommends something (on Twitter, for example), he often is very interested. Oh, yeah, I get that! That’s plain old vanilla referral marketing, only with a web site as a telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear with me: I’m old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, I’m going to start fooling around more with integrating social network content into my sites. That would be in between making drastic changes to my life, working, learning Spanish, and going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least I’m not bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this post serves to announce that intention to my legions of raving fans. Oh, right. As well, it’s a test post, since I’ve just set up TwitterFeeds to Twitter and the MyFace, aka Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see if I can read myself there by writing myself here.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Employees Love You Capitalism Long Time, or, Don’t Quit Your Day Job</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The customary joke for an off-key vocalist or a corny jokester is “don’t quit your day job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lunch with a friend a few days ago, who’s response to my trial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/11/01/employee-owned-software-company/&quot;&gt;organizational charter&lt;/a&gt; was that there was nothing original in it to attract investors except for the organizational structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me he missed the point of an employee owned company. We don’t have investors, except the employees who invest their time and talent. And to be sure, nothing in what I’ve proposed so far amounts to the invention of the World Wide Web or the discovery of a way to turn discarded laptop batteries into crude oil. So as entrepreneurs go I’m a total drudge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the organizational structure is old hat. They even have a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usworker.coop/front&quot;&gt;chamber of commerce&lt;/a&gt; you can join, which as far as I can tell from their like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usworker.coop/membership/benefits&quot;&gt;benefits page&lt;/a&gt; is like most chambers of commerce. For a couple of hundred bucks a year, they’ll take you’re money and send you a newsletter. Nice work if you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Now, now. Nobody wants to own a business with a smartass, John).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So”, I might have asked my friend at lunch, “what’s your idea?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you guessed &amp;quot;he didn’t have one”, you win a Nobel Prize for guessing. But it doesn’t come with a stipend like a real Nobel Prize, so don’t quit your day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly we talked about my friends position _vis a vis _capitalists past and future, so I wasn’t able to wrest the blueprints for the Wheel-less Seque or the Kindle Bottle-opener from him before lunch ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably shouldn’t dwell so much on the dark side. I got a nice note from Jason Mott over at Ronin offering to help me get ParticleWave off the ground, and I got a comment from Dave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, we’re practically Edison’s lab already, and thank God we’re not in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to just go along as though I were an employee owned company already, since if you have one guy, the difference between one guy and an employee owned collective works out to be simply a matter of emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It changes the to-do list a bit, but not by much. I downloaded Skype so I could work remotely with people who aren’t in my company yet, in case they should end up existing. I may upgrade my Unfuddle Account. There may be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0ApiPF3tI9udtdHdTbDdyX2trV0p4Z0EwRE9odWJhQnc&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; or a new bank account involved, to show the newcomers how many hours I’ve worked and how much I’ve capitalized so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who can turn the world on with her smile?&lt;br&gt;
Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?&lt;br&gt;
Well it&amp;#39;s you girl, and you should know it&lt;br&gt;
With each glance and every little movement you show it&lt;br&gt;
Love is all around, no need to waste it&lt;br&gt;
You can have a town, why don&amp;#39;t you take it&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;#39;re gonna make it after all&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;#39;re gonna make it after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed this musical interlude as much as I have. I know, I know: don’t quit your day job.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Knee Jerk Open Source-ialism</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a few conservative friends. I can&amp;#39;t help it. I live in El Dorado County, not Berkeley. One of my conservative friends who I haven&amp;#39;t seen in a few years used to say that his quarrel with liberals was that they had a lot of knee-jerk ideas. A search for &amp;quot;knee jerk liberal&amp;quot; returns 431,000 Google results, while &amp;quot;knee jerk conservative&amp;quot; returns only 408,000, which proves (scientifically, of course) that liberals have 5.6% more knees than conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/KneeJerkOpenSourceialism_C109/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/KneeJerkOpenSourceialism_C109/image_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our abundance of knees is why conservatives less often have a leg to stand on. Unfortunately, this also means we liberals have 5.6% more jerks, so don&amp;#39;t rest on your laurels just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What Has Liberalism to Do With Open Source? *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprised? You may find one of your mental knees trying to jerk as we speak. People seem to innately associate open source with Barrack Obama, gay marriage, and the rest of the rebel alliance, while of course when we think closed source, we generally think of Microsoft, which conjures up Darth Vader, Dick Cheney, and the tanks at Tiananmen Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, don’t blame me. I didn’t make up your mental categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do however find this very interesting. I was beginning to think about this as I started to notice that everywhere I turned when starting to think about creating an Employee Owned Software Collective, I found that the companies out there were all open source companies. The first company I came across was the Ronin Tech Collective, who describe themselves thus:&lt;br&gt;
_&lt;br&gt;
We are a worker-owned and operated technology collective, focused on workplace democracy and promoting a democratic society while supporting progressive businesses, non-profits, and cooperatives by providing open-source website development and consulting._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an email out to them, because that’s all good. (I’m not religious about languages – good socialist that I am, I’m atheistic about them). My point, again, though is that the assumption is that progressivism and open source go together. Check out the United Federation of Worker Cooperative’s welcome of their newest member, which I’ll reprint here since ultimately they’ll end up with a still newer member and the link would be no good:     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to our newest member! Passionate about sustainability,this web design and custom application developer has deep roots in Seattle&amp;#39;s progressive communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you navigate to the company in question, you’ll find that they &lt;em&gt;“[serve] sustainability-driven businesses and organizations with professional Internet expertise. We build highly interactive websites with open source software to help you achieve your goals.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you’re going to “support progressive businesses” or serve “sustainability-driven businesses”, you need to be open source, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? For the same reason “stark” doesn’t go with “hungry”. Nobody’s stark hungry, though we know stark means completely. If you’re stark, then by golly, we all know you’re stark naked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned to my wife that I was thinking about starting an employee owned collective, fine wife as she is, she didn’t say, “What, are you crazy? You have a good job, you’ll go broke.” What she said was: “You should look into Open Source.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is There Anything Wrong With This?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s wrong with a company using Open Source and being Progressive? Nothing at all. Here are a few ideas though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Limit Your Customer Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, there are a lot of companies who are building curly light-bulbs or selling low cruelty mochas, but why should we as an employee run business sell only to them? What if the National Rifle Association wants a web site? Do we turn them down?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Serve Your Employees&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;I just talked to a friend I’ve known for some forty-nine years or so, when our mom’s used to stick us in the same playpen so they could talk. He told me the story of how a bank he used to work for as a DBA wanted to switch from SQL Server to PostgreSQL, and his initial reaction was: “I don’t want that on my resume.” He went on to tell how he met some folks at a PostgreSql conference who told him the story of how they were travelling in a van and concerned that if the Van crashed, there’d be no more PostgreSQL support. Programmers want to work in a place where there skills are transferrable. This is so they can take their marbles and go home if your project gets too stupid. Try this: go up on Dice and search for “Ruby on Rails”, then search for “ASP.NET”. I will wait here for you.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Open Source is Good Because It’s Free&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Well, this is partially true. I’m always amazed at how many blogs _about _ASP.NET are _running _on Wordpress or Blogspot or another non-ASP platform. At the same time, I see the fact that open source Application Service Provider companies don’t offer an upgrade and consulting path for medium to large businesses who want a Microsoft hosted platform to be hosted in house to be a huge opportunity.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as a &lt;em&gt;programmer&lt;/em&gt;, free software is not good. Software that I own (in whole or in part) and can sell is good. Does that mean I’m going to do a bad job or not offer my clients a fair price? No, it just means I’m not working for free.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor union organizers had a word for people who did things cheaply for the bosses. They called them scabs. Of course, in the course of things, labor unions and socialism gave way to liberalism. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lala.com/#song/360569488119466184&quot;&gt;Love me, love me, love me, I’m a Liberal&lt;/a&gt;). Today we who are afraid to be called liberals are known as progressives, and we lament the fate of workers around the world while refusing steadfastly to pay for music, software, or anything else of artistic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Win-Win or Don’t Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of course with working as a programmer for a big company is that you&amp;#39; don’t have a say in how the software is created. Working open source, you can do whatever you want for free, and then try to sell that to people who by definition don’t pay for things. Working as an employee-owner in a closed source shop, you can build your skills and own the software that is sold and forms the basis of the consulting business -- the “means of production”, if you will. Your clients will benefit from your longevity to the company and the dedication with which you take a long term view to create outstanding software. Everybody wins. And nobody gets run over by a tank.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Employee Owned Software Company</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ParticleWave is currently being organized as startup employee owned cooperative, owned and controlled exclusively by its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document is a *&lt;em&gt;DRAFT *&lt;/em&gt;of how that might look – based on one founder’s take on how we might be organized and do business. If others are interested and committed to this idea, then we should probably get together weekly or something and go through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cccd.coop/info/starting_operating_a_coop&quot;&gt;this process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document consists of the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Activities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DRAFT Organizational Structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related Resources / Reading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ParticleWave owners will create multiple lines of business that will, in our consensus opinion, be rewarding to the membership both as people who need to eat and as creative software developers. Some potential business activities include:      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Application Service Provider Model Applications&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;We will create commercial web applications using ASP.NET MVC or other web development environments that will compete directly and favorably with solutions developed by companies like 37 Signals (a Ruby on Rails shop). Unlike 37 Signals, however, we will also offer these applications as licensed solutions sold with or without an associated consulting engagement. [My own preference is to see this grow into our core business model].         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Consulting and Contract Programming and Web Development&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;In addition to creating long term value through service applications owned by the company, we will also create software to be owned by clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRAFT organizational structure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word owner is used throughout as a synonym for owner-employee. Although we may from time to time hire employees who are not asked to stay on as owners (temp workers, contractors, or potential owners on probation), the company will be 100% owned by active employees. (The only exception to this rule is outlined below in “Legacy Ownership”). There is therefore no stock sold outside the company. Also, as much as possible, we will try to have work performed by employee owners, so temporary workers should be the exception and not the rule. It is not our intent to create a core of “senior partners” who benefit from the work of others, but a true cooperative system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Shares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All owners receive one ownership share for every hour of work contributed that is either billable outside the company or contributes to the goals of the company as laid down by the voting owners. A share is a percentage of the yearly profit payout if the company is profitable, with the downside risk that the hour could have been better spent playing World of Warcraft or eating a hamburger. This is not a stock option, which we all know often turns out to be valueless toilet paper, but a full ownership share, which may also turn out to be valueless toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create a mechanism for tracking hours that the members can use. The current number of shares, amount of capitalization, and other income and expense information will be available to all members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company shares may not be transferred or sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voting Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owners who are skilled enough to work billable hours and who wish to help direct the affairs of the company and make a more significant contribution may, with the approval of the existing voting members. Voting members will capitalize the company. The capitalization requirements are $4,800, payable as either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four monthly payments of $200. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight monthly payments of $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voting members expect to work for the company full time, either now or as soon as practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is managed by the informed consensus of all voting owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Board of Directors consisting of not more than five owners will be elected every six months. Their responsibilities will be limited to the following areas of concern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring compliance with Federal, State, and Local laws and tax requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Annually) setting the ratio of gross receipts to be allocated to the general fund versus the membership fund. The general fund should consist of the no more than the amount needed to cover the expenses of the business, plus a prudent reserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with those outside the company (sales, managing vendors etc). Working with the ownership at large to reach a consensus on any and all hiring or firing decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the board will make the same compensation as anyone else, assuming anyone else does. Also, the board should be mindful that it’s purpose is to serve the owners collectively. Shares of ownership and the corresponding dividend payments will always be equal among Non-Voting Members, Voting Members, and the Board. There are no preferred shares, and the rule is one hour of work, one share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other company affairs will be decided at a company meeting to be held at regular intervals. This document naturally can’t cover everything we do. Initially, the meetings will be held weekly. Any matter may be raised by any voting owner, with the outcome to be decided by as much as possible by a consensus. In the event a consensus cannot be reached, the outcome will be decided by a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital shares must be transacted within 90 days of an owner’s termination of their employment.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work shares are retained according to the work share formula described in the section “Ownership Share Formula.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Employee Owned Software -- Why You Should (n&#39;t?) Watch Michael Moore Movies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I met a few out of town friends to see Michael Moore’s Capitalism, a Love Story recently. As usual, Howard Zinn loving socialist that I am, listener to this guy that I am …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this movie was quite appealing to me, and I began to think about how cool it would be to work for an employee owned software collective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, right, it can be an arduous part time struggle to get the thing going while woikin&amp;#39; for the man every night and day. But I never lost a minute of sleepin&amp;#39;, worrying &amp;#39;bout the way things might have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry, that&amp;#39;s a different song, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are a couple of resources if this idea appeals to you as it does to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys actually have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ronincollective.com&quot;&gt;employee owned software collective&lt;/a&gt; in the liberal Ben and Jerry&amp;#39;s Gay Marriage state of Vermont. A collective, no less. Let&amp;#39;s hope Papa Joe Stalin doesn&amp;#39;t come by and wipe them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t socialism exciting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more detail oriented among you may enjoy this (PDF Alert) article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.community-wealth.org/_pdfs/articles-publications/coops/article-logue.pdf&quot;&gt;What Is an Employee Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usworker.coop/front&quot;&gt;bit of a club&lt;/a&gt; we can join. Kind of a Star Trek Economics Chamber of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just hope I’m not the ensign in the red shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaplah, comrades!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>I Can’t Believe You Published Your To-Do List Here. How Can You Possibly Think Anyone Would Be Interested In That?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Things to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop being so boring.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop assuming folks will appreciate introspective jokes.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate ParticleWave and ASPWorkbench further – all the ASP and certification stuff on ASPWorkbench, and all the company related Employee Owned Software stuff on ParticleWave.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPWorkbench will also need a reasonable home page. Readers, don’t go there until I do. Trust me. It’s not even sophomoric.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rework the ParticleWave navigation to reflect the new division of labor.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish the draft ParticleWave Employee Owned Software Company charter.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be not afraid of losing your day job. You need to say what you need to say. This is your outside blog. Be of good cheer.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write your open source-ialism article.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.htaccess Forward ParticleWave’s ASP content to ASPWorkbench.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get permission from your client to write about him, then do, putting the Portfolio page back up.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop being so boring.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t repeat yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Reading and Writing Text Files and Binary Files in .NET</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This short sample shows different ways to read and write binary files and text files. In particular, note the two different techniques for reading and writing text files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;

// This sample demonstrates simple techniques for reading  and writing text and binary files

class SimpleFileIO
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            SimpleFileIO sfio = new SimpleFileIO();

            // Step into each of these functions to see how to read / write 
            // different types of files.
            sfio.TextFilesOneWay();
            sfio.TextFilesAnotherWay();
            sfio.BinaryFiles();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(e.Message + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot; + e.StackTrace);
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;\nPress any key to continue...&amp;quot;);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    void TextFilesOneWay()
    {
        // Use the constructor of the StreamWriter and StreamReader 
        // classes to use a read and write text files
        string filename = &amp;quot;SimpleFileIO_hello.txt&amp;quot;;
        StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(filename);
        sw.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Hello world&amp;quot;);
        sw.Close();


        // Same technique to read it back
        StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(filename);
        string contents = sr.ReadLine();

				<title>Moving from Wordpress to BlogEngine.Net</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the process of migrating the site from a Wordpress blog hosted on HostingRails.com to a BlogEngine.Net blog hosted at Godaddy.com. You can consider this a guide to setting up a BlogEngine.Net site at Godaddy.com, but first, two words of caution about doing such a migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first word of caution: fiction writers say that if you want to make a character interesting, present him with adversity. Unfortunately, presenting characters with adversity in real life doesn’t make us any more interesting – it only makes us write tutorials. Expect delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your second word of caution: If you’re not writing about ASP.NET or adding a blog to an ASP.NET web site, or if you don’t need to be on an ASP.NET platform for some other good reason, what the hell are you thinking? BlogEngine.net has some cool features, but for the most part &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordpress works significantly better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There, I came out and said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Godaddy’s Support for BlogEngine.NET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wasn’t able to do what I tried in the first go around, which was to just download the BlogEngine.net 1.5 release candidate and push it up to the site. Perhaps I was tired after a long day of work, and your mileage may vary, but what I ended up doing was installing BlogEngine.Net it from Godaddy’s application control panel. From the Hosting management page, click on the “Your Applications Link” (shown at left), then select “Blog” from the left hand navbar and then BlogEngine.Net. In my case I got a compatibility warning because I was running IIS 7.0 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/244/how-to-take-advantage-of-the-iis7-integrated-pipeline/&quot;&gt;Integrated Mode rather than Classic Mode&lt;/a&gt; (who knew), so I had to click on “Purchase Compatible” then “Select compatible hosted domain” to work through what was going wrong, then return to “Content / IIS Configuration” to get it squared away. Once I did that it was pretty much smooth sailing, but at one point I either messed up the application, so I needed to make sure my blog directory (where blogengine.net was installed) was configured as an application:       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_thumb_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking the edit pencil button brings up this window, and you want to make sure Set Application Root is checked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_thumb_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing Wordpress Posts to BlogEngine.Net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re first step for this part of your journey is to get the BlogML export tool from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogml.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=171&quot;&gt;Codeplex BlogML downloads page&lt;/a&gt;. You want the download that says “Wordpress BlogML Export”. When you unzip this file, you’ll get a single export.php that works as a replacement for the default Wordpress export page. Backup up export.php in your &lt;wordpress folder&gt;/wp-admin directory, install this file, and run the Wordpress export from the admin panel to create a BlogML export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at this point you might want to give some thought to manually reviewing this file and removing duplicate posts, which could be a very tedious process. The export file created by this tool is likely to have any number of versions of some of your posts, and when you import into BlogEngine.net, your blog is going to stutter like a Porky Pig cartoon. When you run the BlogEngine.net import tool, there’s a handy checkbox “Remove Duplicate Posts” you can check. It doesn’t do anything, but you can check it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/blog/MovingfromWordpresstoBlogEngine.Net_1250F/image_thumb_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you’re running BlogEngine.Net 1.5 this has been fixed and it does something. That would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quirky aspect of this tool is that it doesn’t give you any sort of progress indicator letting you know what’s going on, so while it’s doing the import it pretty much looks like it’s gone to lunch. I recommend pushing the two validate buttons before you start the import, that way you know everything’s set up correctly, then be prepared to wait several minutes while it does its thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it finishes, your posts will be there, complete with Porky Pig stutters, but you’ll find your categories and tags weren’t imported. Oh well, what did I tell you at the beginning? Adversity won’t make you interesting, it will only make you write a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Converting Your Wordpress Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next your ready to convert your Wordpress theme. You’re probably not going to like this part, but here’s how I did it. Open up your favorite text editor and file difference tool, pick a target third party BlogEngine.net theme such as “Standard”, and code yourself a theme, there, fella. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspworkbench.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Here’s how mine turned out&lt;/a&gt;, combining the ASPWorkbench / ParticleWave theme with the Standard theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it! Delete your duplicate posts, re-enter your categories, and rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>DirectoryInfo Example</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of our DriveInfo example, which was a little slip of a thing, here&amp;#39;s a DriveInfo example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

class DirectoryInfoExample
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string dir = @&amp;quot;C:\&amp;quot;;
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Listing directories underneath {0}&amp;quot;, dir);
        DirectoryInfo diList = new DirectoryInfo(dir);
        foreach (DirectoryInfo di in diList.GetDirectories())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;{0}&amp;quot;, di.FullName);
        }
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Listing files in {0}&amp;quot;, dir);

        foreach (FileInfo fi in diList.GetFiles())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;File name:  {0}\nCreated:  {1},\nLength:   {2} bytes&amp;quot;, 
                 fi.Name, fi.CreationTime, fi.Length);
        }
        Console.ReadKey();     
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>BlogEngine.NET Comes to The Workbench</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve started to develop a modest control for displaying ASP.NET certification exam questions and some other bits and pieces of code that I haven&amp;#39;t written about yet, it got to be pretty obvious that writing about ASP.NET on a PHP blog was a lot like trying to get married on top of a backhoe. Yes, it&amp;#39;s possible in principle, but for most purposes it&amp;#39;s probably best avoided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More concretely, I want to be able to roll exam questions into a blog post and let folks comment on them, while still having a database of questions and being able to develop the exam logic independently of the blog. Also, I want to write ASP.NET code and be able to display it in the blog. Some of that’s certainly doable using tricks like Web Services, but that’s not a lightweight approach to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tonight while the old body was begging me for a nap, good programmer that I am I threw some caffeine at the problem and put up a quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspworkbench.com/blog&quot;&gt;BlogEngine.NET blog on AspWorkbench&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What – no ParticleWave theme yet? Hey man, I just installed it. Chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I’ve never installed a BlogEngine.NET instance on Godaddy before, it wasn’t too awful – I’ll try to write some tips tomorrow while they’re still somewhat fresh in my mind but when I’m a bit more coherent. There are several quirks that need polishing. For example, although I got the test email to succeed after some searching, neither the contact form nor the “Send email when someone posts a comment” feature have decided to join the party. The installation was something of a pain having been through several successful “Wordpress famous fifteen minute” installs, but some of that was first time learning curve. On the plus side, Live Writer connected and worked with no trouble at all, which is a big deal for me because I’m a Live Writer junkie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I’m now in a position to integrate more ASP.NET into my blogging about ASP.NET – go figure!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Featured .NET Certification Study Question</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We have a new featured question over on the ASPWorkbench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is:     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of the following are differences between XML Serialization and standard serialization? Check all that apply.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) XML Serialization allows both public and private data members to be serialized, while standard serialization supports only public data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) Only standard serialization uses the [Serializable] attribute to determine if a class is serializable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C) Using the BinaryFormatter class along with standard serialization allows for more runtime efficiency than XML Serialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D) Standard serialization does not support the SOAP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the answer, head over to the Workbench while this is still the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspworkbench.com/blog/&quot;&gt;featured question&lt;/a&gt;. (I know, that’s a bit of a cheesy process, but I just haven’t yet had time to get the archives and the site registration going – coming soon though).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s So Funny About the UpdatePanel Control, Love and Understanding?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/09/18/certification-and-its-discontents/&quot;&gt;I recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that I had a domain for an ASP.NET site to hack around on with nothing on it yet. Since then I’ve made some progress and had some fun coding some ASP.NET, so I can now show off a minor feature on a new web site, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspworkbench.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Featured ASP.NET Certification Question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t exactly Google or even StackOverflow yet, to be sure, but there were nevertheless a fair bit of learning and practice goals along the way to this simple looking page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Site and The Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I ported the master page from this site, so that was worth remembering how to do. Master pages can also expose properties to their content pages, which I haven’t done yet, but perhaps I’ll get into that when I add authentication to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next steps were to set up a brain-dead and stubbed out custom control, ExamQuestionControl, while on the lower decks working out the database structure and connection strings for development and production and testing along the way using NUnit tests (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/07/23/development-driven-development/&quot;&gt;Yes, Dan&lt;/a&gt;, NUnit Tests). Once those were in place I began testing out the Plain Old CLR Objects and a simple, one method repository consisting of “QuestionFindByID”, which was all I needed at this point. I implemented the repository using very basic (and hence certification-friendly) calls into the ADO.NET Connected Classes (one of which forms the basis for my first Featured Question). Once NUnit had lifted the database up by its bootstraps, It was quite a simple matter to un-stub the formerly brain-dead ExamQuestionControl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the control was more or less working, I decided (as if setting myself up to take a look at the AJAX chapter) that I didn’t like the fact that the “Show Answer” button posted back the entire page to the server. Microsoft’s UpdatePanel control provided an elegantly simple way to AJAX enable my control to avoid a full page refresh. No seriously. If your hatred of Microsoft is interfering with your Buddhist practice, sit still and contemplate the UpdatePanel control, and you’ll be filled with loving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Hiccups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earliest stages of the work, getting the hosting set up and so forth, I ran into a few noteworthy hurdles. One was that I needed to compile the site and bin deploy the code-behind pages. Other problems involved &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/266205/is-there-a-way-that-i-can-run-a-asp-net-mvc-project-on-godaddy-com-shared-web-hos/1416036#1416036&quot;&gt;deploying an MVC site to godaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;, but as you can see from the link, a kind fellow traveler provided the solution. Before I found that link, I had to re-code the master pages to inherit from System.Web.UI.MasterPage instead of System.Web.Mvc.ViewMasterPage. Once I found that link, however, I was able to restore the ViewMasterPage with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would recommend to your attention when you get to the deployment phase of your project is to right click on your project and check out the “Publish…” menu option. As others pointed out in the earlier link, the easiest thing to do turned out to be to publish to a local directory and upload files. The link above shows you how to bin deploy MVC, and that trick no doubt works on other weird dependency issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’d played with that a bit I decided to clean up what I’d originally uploaded, and noticed then that Visual Studio’s publish doesn’t copy over image files referenced in your CSS if you select the option to only copy what’s needed. Copy those, end of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Certification and Its Discontents</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m nowhere near finished with my study for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/15/microsoft-exam-70-536/&quot;&gt;70-536&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve begun to start thinking about and working toward my next study goal, 70-562, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Application Development&lt;/em&gt;. The Self-Paced training kit came from Amazon last night, and I’ll have the subject outline up here soon and start filling it in as I’m already doing for 70-536. As I’m writing this, SQL Server 2008 Management Studio Express is installing away in the background, because as I discovered this evening, trying to get any kind of serious database scripting done inside of Visual Studio alone is like trying to program C Sharp in &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa214007%28SQL.80%29.aspx&quot;&gt;isql&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh alright, it’s not that bad, but if you can’t be inaccurate using a metaphor, then what good are metaphors, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase of our little certification pony show is likely to be a good deal more labor intensive than the first phase. The nice thing about studying for 70-536 is that it lends itself readily to sort of brain dead little “Hello World” example that I used to write twenty years ago when I was first learning to code in C. This is good for blogging in the evening after a somewhat tiring day in the procedural salt mines. The study for 70-562, in contrast, is likely to require bigger bits of code, especially if I want to get to something I can not only learn from in a quick and dirty way, but also publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas for how that will go, and now I have a new domain to host it on, but there’s nothing there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not all that discontent – just weary, and I thought it was a cool title, what with old Sigmund having anticipated it and all.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mixing ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC in the same project – A Visual Studio Starter Project</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of good reasons to dive into Stephen Walther’s ASP.NET MVC Framework Unleashed. I won’t go into all of them now – perhaps I’ll write a review when I’m further into it. My short recommendation is to go buy it, especially if you’re going to do so by clicking the link at the right, whereby I’ll make a whopping 29 cents or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And meantime, in a paradox that proves once again that information doesn’t always need to be perfect to be useful, I believe one of Walther’s weaker chapters (in terms of eloquence) was simultaneously one of his stronger chapters (in terms of usefulness). This is the chapter on deployment, which deals (in part) with how you can add ASP.NET MVC to an existing ASP.NET application. This was a really useful chapter in its broad outline, even if the layout of the file “diffs” left a lot to be desired, leaving some of the details a bit sketchy. The short version is that you sit down for a couple of hours over coffee and merge files and add dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the information Walther provided to put together a starter Visual Studio 2008 project that allows you to use ASP.NET “classic” web forms together with ASP.NET MVC models / views / controllers in the same project. (I also chose the unit testing option so there are tests built in). I’ll try to do some more pounding on it before you read this, so it should be workable enough that the only thing you’ll want to do is rename all the namespaces and so forth from AspNetStarter to whatever you want to call your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you find it useful. If so I put it together. If not, I had nothing to do with it. Here it is as a 389 Kb or so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/asp_net/AspNetStarter.zip&quot;&gt;zip file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>IComparable Example</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a quick IComparable example. The memorization feat for this interface is that CompareTo returns &lt;0 when “this” is less than the object passed to it. The rest follows easily: return 0 when both objects are equal and &gt; 0 when this instance greater than obj passed to CompareTo. Remember, this is self centered so everything’s in terms of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;

// A simple class that implements IComparable 
// interface to sort by title
class Book : IComparable
{  
    private string m_title;
    private string m_author;

    public Book(string _title, string _author)
    {
        m_title = _title;
        m_author = _author;
    }

    public string Title
    {
        get { return m_title; }
        set { m_title = value; }
    }

    public string Author
    {
        get { return m_author; }
        set { m_author = value; }
    }

    // We let Visual Studio do the stub implementation, 
    // then we filled it out. 
    #region IComparable Members

    public int CompareTo(object obj)
    {
    // This instance comes before null.
        if (obj == null)
            return 1;

        else if (!(obj is Book))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(&amp;quot;Object passed to Book::CompareTo is not a Book&amp;quot;);
        }
        else
        {
            return Title.CompareTo(((Book)obj).Title);
        }
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return Title + &amp;quot; by &amp;quot; + Author;
    }

    #endregion
}

class IComparableTest
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SortedList list = new SortedList();

        // Add in unsorted order.  Sorted list will sort by key (Book) using
        // the CompareTo method we implemented
        list.Add(new Book(&amp;quot;The thrill of victory&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Some Lucky Winning Guy&amp;quot;), 0);
        list.Add(new Book(&amp;quot;A Loser Speaks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Melvin Nobody&amp;quot;), 1);
        list.Add(new Book(&amp;quot;Zymurgy Unleashed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Aaron Firstman&amp;quot;), 2);

        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; list.Count; i++)
        {            
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Entered at:  {0}, a Book:  {1}&amp;quot;, list.GetByIndex(i), list.GetKey(i));
        }

        // Uncomment this to see if running in debugger:
        // Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>.NET Regular Expressions Example: Basic use of Match and MatchCollection</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the first of what should really be several .NET Regular Expressions examples. I firmly believe that in any given environment, you’re going to end up spending most of your programming career manipulating strings one way or another. Because of this, learning .NET’s regular expression support -- unlike many of the other topics you’re likely to encounter on the certification exam, is not one of those Use It and Lose It things. It’s something that’s really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace GlobalizationDrawingText
{
    class RegularExpressionExample1
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Let&amp;#39;s set up a needle to search for and a couple of haystacks
            Regex re = new Regex(&amp;quot;needle&amp;quot;);
            string haystack = &amp;quot;hay hay hay needle hay haybeatle hay_dirt hay hay&amp;quot;;
            string needleless /* to say */ = &amp;quot;hay hay hay hay hay&amp;quot;;

            // Do some really simple matching
            Match match1 = re.Match(haystack);
            Match match2 = re.Match(needleless);
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Haystack had &amp;quot;
                + (match1.Success ? &amp;quot;a needle.&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no needles.&amp;quot;));
            Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Needleless had &amp;quot; 
                + (match2.Success ? &amp;quot;a needle.&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no needles.&amp;quot;));

            // Let&amp;#39;s use MatchCollection to gather some hay.
            // Motivation:  what the hay.
            re = new Regex(@&amp;quot;hay\w*\b&amp;quot;);
            MatchCollection mc = re.Matches(haystack);
            foreach (Match hay in mc)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Found:  {0}&amp;quot;, hay.Value);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

				<title>Early ASP.NET MVC Troubleshooting</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After happily switching between Visual 2005 and Visual Studio 2010 beta for several days, I installed Visual Studio 2008 recently so I could get started on ASP.NET MVC. Well Hello World worked more or less without a hitch, but inside that “more or less” are two stumbling blocks I hit which I mention here in case anyone else stubs their toes in the same place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the Visual Studio install didn’t work. It turned out this was either a virus scanner or automated backup. Turning both off as recommended in the Microsoft troubleshooting docs did the trick.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second little bit of trouble came when trying to create a new SQL Server database file in the App_Data folder to start playing around with something beyond Hello World.

				<title>Microsoft ASP.NET MVC: A Glimmer of Hope for Ruby Programmers (or is that ASP.NET Programmers?)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/15/late-born-head-case-ponders-microsoft-certification/&quot;&gt;Late born head case&lt;/a&gt; that I am, I vibrate between programming languages like a sort of high tech lady’s toy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyze that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus it is that I wrote an article recently comparing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/04/19/aspnet-versus-ruby-on-rails/&quot;&gt;ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;.  In that article I mentioned Microsoft’s pathetic support for the Model View Controller pattern.  This was based on work I’d done an eon ago in programming time, 2006 or 2007 or so.  With that I was able to declare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may have changed since I last looked at it, but on my last ASP.NET contract they had an MVC implementation that completely broke browser navigation and was a nightmare to code to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I don’t have all the details yet, but I’m happy to report that since that glib dismissal Microsoft has had Ruby in its sights in a big way, and has further refined something they were no doubt working on when I made that dated statement.  (You know what print journalists bag on us bloggers for – we’re light on our fact checking).  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asp.net/mvc/&quot;&gt;Microsoft MVC&lt;/a&gt; complete with a 15 minute podcast by Stephen Walther.  Look familiar?  It should.  Of course this is straight out of the Ruby on Rails 15 minute podcast, which in turn was lifted whole cloth from the pioneering work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coboloncogs.org&quot;&gt;Cobol on Cogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobol on Cogs was obviously a parody of Ruby on Rails, and I’m sure there are Ruby programmers who probably consider ASP.NET MVC to be in the same category, though interestingly enough, the official rails blog mentions Cobol on Cogs but not ASP.NET MVC.  Much of what you can find there are bashes of ASP.NET (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/7/5/not-knowing-where-it-hurts-in-asp-net&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/8/25/dont-look-at-rails-if-you-have-to-do-net&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) that were absolutely legitimate in 2005 but might be getting a bit obsolete by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to take a look at ASP.NET MVC, and in case I end up hating it, let me be the first to call it this:   Cobol on Cogs 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime I certainly wouldn’t count out Microsoft’s ability to steal someone else’s ideas, market them, and provide me with a job in the process.  C Sharp, after all, is “Java run through a thesaurus”, and Redmond has the law suits to prove it.  I suspect we’re in the next phase of this, and I find it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to spend another hour or two on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;coolest programming web site ever&lt;/a&gt;, which incidentally is written in ASP.NET MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Review of Stephen Walther’s ASP.NET MVC Framework Unleashed</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a reprint of a review I did on Amazon.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought Stephen Walther&amp;#39;s ASP.NET MVC Framework Unleashed after several months of working on a legacy C and C++ project which looks nothing like Walther&amp;#39;s book. Following that I spent many a happy Saturday and Sunday ramping up on Ruby on Rails, but finally giving up to revisit my Microsoft skills. ASP.NET MVC is a serious attempt by Microsoft to lure wayward Ruby on Rails types like me back into the fold, and I consider myself re-folded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my background, any halfway decent book on ASP.NET MVC would probably have been welcome, but Walther&amp;#39;s book is especially welcome because it makes a serious attempt to treat ASP.NET MVC in the context of Test Driven Development. Well, all of that is what you&amp;#39;d expect if you take the cynical view that Microsoft is competing for developer mind share against Ruby on Rails, where the tests are &amp;quot;baked right in&amp;quot; (of course they all pass by default, but that&amp;#39;s another story). But Walther&amp;#39;s book is far more than a cheerleading book about TDD, and actually gets you into how to structure your code to support it. Using a generic repository class and relying heavily on the dependency injection pattern, Walther leads you through setting up your code so that it&amp;#39;s loosely coupled, testable, and (presumably) easily refactored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it sometimes looks like Walther&amp;#39;s approach takes too much manual lifting compared to Ruby on Rails -- and that&amp;#39;s especially true when you run into Microsoft annoyances like not being able to refresh an Entity Data Model from the database. On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s hard for an experienced software developer not to take a skeptical view of the magical rails &amp;quot;we can build a blog in 15 minutes&amp;quot; approach to the world. But still I feel that the techniques Walther talks about are the kind of thing that I really need to try out on an application or two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave the book four stars because there were a few sections that I thought could have been explained better. For example, I used his chapter on deployment almost immediately to create an application that supports both &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot; ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC, and the information there worked great, but I felt the file differences could have been narrowed down a bit more. Also in his discussion of the generic repository, I felt like we lost sight of the model there for awhile. Since there was a lot of ground to cover, a general overview discussing how the Entity Data Framework, the model, the repository and the service layer were all going to tie together might have been helpful. My final quibble is that I felt there could have been a bit more material on the relationships among the Entity Data Framework, LINQ, and LINQ to SQL. I think Walther&amp;#39;s book gave the impression that the EDF and LINQ are orthogonal, whereas other Microsoft sources lead me to believe they&amp;#39;re more complimentary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its flaws, however, I want to leave you with the title of my review, that this is one of the best programming books I&amp;#39;ve read in a long time. It&amp;#39;s the kind of book that expands your horizons and makes you want to try things out the way the author has outlined. To be sure, Walther&amp;#39;s book is not the book you want to read if you goal is to hack together an unstructured ASP.NET MVC application in record time. But if your goal is to learn ASP.NET MVC while becoming a better programmer along the way, this book merits your serious attention and you should be pulling your credit card out now.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Delegates and Events</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In .NET, delegates are classes that implement type safe function pointers.  Like all function pointers, they can be used whereever you need dynamic execution of code.  One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&amp;#39;re raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this was the first sample I developed using Visual Studio 2010 beta (though it compiles and runs fine under 2005 as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;
using System;

/*
 *  Since we&amp;#39;ll be raising events, we create a simple
 *  EventArgs class that knows about System.ConsoleModifiers 
 *  (i.e. keyboard states like CTRL, ALT, SHIFT)
 */
public class KeyEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    private ConsoleModifiers _cm;

    public KeyEventArgs(ConsoleModifiers cm)
    {
        _cm = cm;
    }
    public ConsoleModifiers Modifiers
    {
        get { return _cm; }
    }
}

/*
 * Define an event delegate.  Our publisher defines instances
 * of this delegate.  Our subscribers add event handlers to the 
 * publisher&amp;#39;s delegates for the events they&amp;#39;re interested in.
 */
public delegate void KeyEventDelegate(object obj, KeyEventArgs e);

/* 
 * A simple event publisher.  Translate keypresses into events that
 * a subscriber can subscribe to.
 * */
class KeyPublisher
{
    // Translate keypresses into events
    public void KeypressToEvent(ConsoleKeyInfo pressed)
    {
        // No event generated for a plain old key
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Pressed:  {0}&amp;quot;, pressed.KeyChar);

        // Now the plot thickens
        if (pressed.Modifiers != 0)
        {
            KeyEventArgs kea = new KeyEventArgs(pressed.Modifiers);

            // Alt key pressed?
            if ((pressed.Modifiers &amp;amp; ConsoleModifiers.Alt) != 0)
            {
                // I.e., if someone has subscribed
                if (AltKeyPressed != null)
                {
                    // Raise an event
                    AltKeyPressed(this, kea);
                }
            }

            // Etc...
            if ((pressed.Modifiers &amp;amp; ConsoleModifiers.Control) != 0)
            {
                if (ControlKeyPressed != null) 
                    ControlKeyPressed(this, kea);
            }

            if ((pressed.Modifiers &amp;amp; ConsoleModifiers.Shift) != 0)
            {
                if (ShiftKeyPressed != null)
                    ShiftKeyPressed(this, kea);
            }
        }

    }

    public static event KeyEventDelegate AltKeyPressed = null;
    public static event KeyEventDelegate ShiftKeyPressed = null;
    public static event KeyEventDelegate ControlKeyPressed = null;
}

/*
 * Create some simple event hanlders we can use.  We&amp;#39;ll wire these
 * up below in our sample &amp;quot;Main&amp;quot;
 */
class KeySubscriber
{
    // Function signature matches our delegate
    public void HandleControlKey(Object ojb, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Control key pressed&amp;quot;);
    }

    // Function signature matches our delegate
    public void HandleAltKey(Object ojb, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Alt key pressed&amp;quot;);
    }   

    // But I&amp;#39;m not interested in Shift keys
}


class EventHandlerExample
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a publisher to fire events
        KeyPublisher pub = new KeyPublisher();

        // Create a subscriber to respond to them
        KeySubscriber sub = new KeySubscriber();

        // Link event handlers to events
        KeyPublisher.AltKeyPressed += sub.HandleAltKey;
        KeyPublisher.ControlKeyPressed += sub.HandleControlKey;

        // Read keys and translate to events
        ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo;
        bool finished = false;
        while (! finished)
        {
            keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
            switch (keyInfo.KeyChar)
            {
                case &amp;#39;Q&amp;#39;:
                case &amp;#39;q&amp;#39;:
                    finished = true;
                    break;

                default:
                    // Publish!
                    pub.KeypressToEvent(keyInfo);
                    break;
            }
        }

    }
}


&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output of course varies depending on what keys you press. One possibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;
aPressed:  a
bPressed:  b
☻Pressed:  ☻
Control key pressed
◄Pressed:  ◄
Control key pressed
♦Pressed:  ♦
Control key pressed
aPressed:  a
Alt key pressed
 Pressed:
Alt key pressed
Control key pressed
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

				<title>Reference Types Versus Value Types</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Value types include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple types such as numeric types (int, long, float, decimal) and bool (&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1ax56ch.aspx&quot;&gt;Full List&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enumerations &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User defined structs . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All value types are derived from System.ValueType.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, value types directly contain values. The values are stored on the stack, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;int i = 1;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value types generally cannot contain null values, with the exception of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/20/nullable-types-example/&quot;&gt;Nullable&lt;/a&gt; types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because value types directly contain values, assigning a value type makes a copy of the value. In contrast, assigning a reference type to a new variable makes a new reference pointing to the original type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;

// A really simple Reference class for testing -- 
// wrap an int.
class ReferenceTest
{
    private int val;

    public int Val
    {
        get 
        {
            return val;
        }
        set
        {
            val = value;
        }
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return val.ToString();
    }
};

class ValueVersusReference
{
    static void Main()
    {

      ReferenceTest ref1, ref2;
      ref1 = new ReferenceTest();
      ref1.Val = 42;
      // ref2 points to same memory as ref1
      ref2 = ref1;
      // therefore changing ref1 will be reflected in ref2
      ref1.Val = 52;
      Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;ref1 = {0}\nref2 = {1}&amp;quot;, ref1, ref2);

      int val1, val2;
      val1 = 42;
      // val2 is a copy of val1
      val2 = val1;
      // changing val1 has no effect on val2
      val1 = 52;
      Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;val1 = {0}\nval2 = {1}&amp;quot;, val1, val2);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code outputs: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;ref1 = 52
ref2 = 52
val1 = 52
val2 = 42
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Nullable Types Example</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The memory for reference types is allocated on the system heap, so it makes sense that reference variables can be null. Value types, in contrast, cannot be assigned a &amp;quot;null” value by default. Still, there are times when you may want to declare a int (for example) and allow it to be set null – one obvious use is in reading and writing data from a database. Enter the Nullable type. Here’s a brief sample that shows how these types work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;using System;

class NullableExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
    // A basic value type can be assigned to, but cannot be null
    int normal;
    normal = 1;

    // The line below if uncommented produces:
    // error CS0037: Cannot convert null to &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; because 
    // it is a value type

    // normal = null;

    // Declare a Nullable value
    int? nullable = null;

    // The type? syntax used above is a synonym for Nullable&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;
    // So the following is equivalent
    System.Nullable&amp;lt;system.int32&amp;gt; nullable2 = 5;

    // Display something -- the null for nullable displays nothing
        System.Console.WriteLine(
        &amp;quot;normal = {0}, nullable = {1}, nullable2 = {2}&amp;quot;, 
        normal, nullable, nullable2);

    // HasValue returns true if the Nullable type has a value
    Console.WriteLine(
        &amp;quot;nullable.HasValue = {0}, nullable2.HasValue = {1}&amp;quot;,
        nullable.HasValue, nullable2.HasValue);

    // Value returns the value or throws an exception if there is no value
    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Doesn&amp;#39;t display:  {0}&amp;quot;, nullable.Value);
    }
    catch (System.InvalidOperationException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Exception caught: &amp;quot; + e);
    }   

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;normal = 1, nullable = , nullable2 = 5
nullable.HasValue = False, nullable2.HasValue = True
Exception caught: System.InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value.
   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowInvalidOperationException(ExceptionResource resource)
   at NullableExample.Main()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Microsoft 750-36 Skills Being Measured: Developing Applications That Use System Types and Collections</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing applications that use system types and collections (15 percent)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our student notes on the Microsoft 70-536 certification exam, we&amp;#39;ll occasionally post portions of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-536&amp;amp;locale=en-us#tab2&quot;&gt;Microsoft outline&lt;/a&gt; here with links to our notes as we create them. Our first topic breaks down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manage data in a .NET Framework application by using .NET Framework system types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/22/reference-types-versus-value-types/&quot;&gt;Value types&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/20/nullable-types-example/&quot;&gt;Nullable type&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/22/reference-types-versus-value-types/&quot;&gt;Reference types&lt;/a&gt;; Attributes; Generic types; Exception classes; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/24/boxing-and-unboxing-in-non-generic-collections-versus-generic-collections/&quot;&gt;Boxing and UnBoxing &lt;/a&gt;; TypeForwardedToAttribute class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manage a group of associated data in a .NET Framework application by using collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/24/boxing-and-unboxing-in-non-generic-collections-versus-generic-collections/&quot;&gt;ArrayList class&lt;/a&gt;; Collection interfaces; Iterators; Hashtable class; CollectionBase class and ReadOnlyCollectionBase class; DictionaryBase class and DictionaryEntry class; Comparer class; Queue class; SortedList class; BitArray class; Stack class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improve type safety and application performance in a .NET Framework application by using generic collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: Collection.Generic interfaces; Generic Dictionary; Generic Comparer class and Generic EqualityComparer class; Generic KeyValuePair structure; Generic List class, Generic List.Enumerator structure, and Generic SortedList class; Generic Queue class and Generic Queue.Enumerator structure; Generic SortedDictionary class; Generic LinkedList; Generic Stack class and Generic Stack.Enumerator structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manage data in a .NET Framework application by using specialized collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: Specialized String classes; Specialized Dictionary; Named collections; CollectionsUtil; BitVector32 structure and BitVector32.Section structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implement .NET Framework interfaces to cause components to comply with standard contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/09/14/icomparable-example/&quot;&gt;IComparable interface&lt;/a&gt;; IDisposable interface; IConvertible interface; ICloneable interface; IEquatable interface; IFormattable interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control interactions between .NET Framework application components by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/28/delegates-and-events/&quot;&gt;events and delegates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May include but is not limited to: Delegate class; EventArgs class; EventHandler delegates&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dell Studio 17 Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m told that somewhere around the dawn of software development, when processor time was hugely expensive and multiple university departments shared a single computing resource, it was common to have to work out your software problems using a sharpened pencil or similar Flintstones-level tool before your code ever felt the warm embrace of powered silicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t know about that. I’m old, but I’m not THAT old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, doing such a thing would be pretty much unthinkable, which is why it’s nice to be able to report that having sacrificed the Windows partition of my desktop machine to the dubious goal of getting faster Ruby on Rails unit tests working, I’m not content to envision my Microsoft Certification on Ubuntu, but have treated myself to a new Dell laptop. It’s a Studio 17”, model s1737-020B, and it’s quite the spiffy little workhorse so far. It’s fairly light for the size and price, has plenty of USB holes so the USB can get in, but also sports an HDMI hole so the digital video can go somewhere – though I must say that even though setting up an extended desktop was the first thing I did, so far I’ve spent most of my time looking at the built-in display for most tasks. It found my wireless network with no fuss at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery life is supposed to be quite good though I’ve yet to test that. 4 gig of RAM, half a terabyte hard drive, $749 at Best Buy. The front side bus speed is 800 MHz, the two processors runs at 2.1 GHz, so those numbers are a tad lower than some of seen out there, but I don’t think I’ll be doing huge builds just yet so that’s probably all I need, and all things considered I’m very happy with it. Hat tip to the Best Buy folks in Folsom, a very congenial and generally fairly knowledgeable bunch. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Microsoft Exam 70-536</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I announced that I&amp;#39;m going to be working toward Microsoft Certification and writing my student notes about it here, so I thought I&amp;#39;d hop right in and save my stub page for our first exam, 70-536, also known as &lt;em&gt;Microsoft .NET Framework -- Application Development Foundation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using Tony Northrup&amp;#39;s Self-Paced Training Kit for now.  What I&amp;#39;ll be doing here are samples and articles that don&amp;#39;t appear in Tony&amp;#39;s book, but obviously I owe a debt to this work.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Late Born Head Case Ponders Microsoft Certification</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;About every six months or so, I completely change platforms and direction in my software career.  That may be because I&amp;#39;m a head case, but if you read &amp;quot;How the Mind Works&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll stumble upon the more charitable explanation that as the last born in my family my personality developed with a view to embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charity begins at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably need to get certified, on some level.  I don&amp;#39;t mean I need it or I won&amp;#39;t have a job, per se, although it&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that may open up opportunities around here.  As you might expect, the Sacramento programmer market has a lot of government work going on, and government hiring tends to be driven by the check box.  And of course, being the kind of late born head case that I am, I need to have more opportunities than if I were a conservative first born drudge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually start thinking about certification in response to reaching a trough in fretting about my status.  (The wave itself runs perpetually.)  I have this relentless need to make some pathetic mark on the world, as if that could be done with a keyboard and a Microsoft Certification.  Perhaps fortunately, I&amp;#39;m generally able to suppress my ambition in order to grab whatever tarnished brass ring of a maintenance job happens to fly by my little software hobby horse of life.  It&amp;#39;s a late born head case thing: we know how to make do with hand-me-downs, all the while secretly plotting to someday have our own pair of jeans for once.  As with pants, so with code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was maudlin.  Both my older siblings were sisters, so the truth is I got my own clothes.  My parents were wonderful people, and like most folks they weren&amp;#39;t about to go raising any &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; transvestites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey look, if you&amp;#39;re a transvestite, nothing personal, OK?  Jeesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if I make good on my threat, then I&amp;#39;ll have something to write about.  No longer will I be working on a double secret probation Rails project where I can&amp;#39;t share my code.  Instead, I&amp;#39;ll be working on code so trivial in all but a pedagogical sense that only a Cheney-level paranoid would keep it in a man-sized office safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the new blog.  Same as the old blog.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Development Driven Development</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I waxed ecstatic over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/JUnit.php&quot;&gt;JUnit automated unit tests&lt;/a&gt; here, and I think the software community has gotten even more wild-eyed over automated tests in the meantime, with the latest buzz about Behavior Driven Development.  For my part, lately I&amp;#39;ve begun to question all this conventional wisdom.  I&amp;#39;ve begun to believe that the fact that programmers love testing so much for the same reason Twitter is so popular:  writing short little works is more fun than reading something long and difficult.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, MY test case is elegant and concise, whereas YOUR legacy code is convoluted and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong.  My legacy code is convoluted and difficult, too, but it&amp;#39;s a lot more convoluted and difficult for you than it is for me, because I wrote it, and I have a better than even chance of knowing where the tasty bits are and what I was thinking.  Your code is sometimes worse than mine, and sometimes better, but either way I don&amp;#39;t know it as well as my code until I start grepping and reading and stepping through it in the debugger.  After a while doing that, I become more proficient in your code, but it&amp;#39;s still YOUR code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I make my living reading and fixing YOUR code.  Well not yours exactly, but Other People&amp;#39;s Code.  The particular compilation of Other People&amp;#39;s Code that pays my bills lately has been evolving since the 1980s, with very little in the way of automated testing.  Yet my employers are selling the product and making enough revenue to hire me and a bunch of other guys to work on it.  To be sure, it may be nearing the end of its life cycle, in which case I may need to find OTHER Other People&amp;#39;s code to go work on, but I guarantee you that in the meantime my wife doesn&amp;#39;t mind when she cooks dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got to this job I lamented the fact that there were no native automated unit tests.  I wrote a few, but not nearly as many as I&amp;#39;d like, nor nearly as many as we need.  QA has also been recently trying to add a lot more automation, though they&amp;#39;re written in the tool we&amp;#39;re developing -- not the language I&amp;#39;m working in.  More and more I just try to bite the bullet and debug and fix the problems that get logged by ad hoc testing against Other People&amp;#39;s Code, and I try not to let my overwhelming agile genius keep me from having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a younger programmer than I am now, at my first true development job, my agile genius was at the height of his awesome career.  As I was explaining some ingenious and difficult idea to my manager, he detected my agile genius at work.  He rewarded my heroic efforts with the following response, which I offer up to you now as a Development Driven Development manifesto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;Just write the damned code.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Write The Damned Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think many developers are going to go for this as a way of doing business, because just writing the damned code is not really theoretical, and we developers love our theories.  This sounds too much like chaos, and too many of us have suffered from chaos as a model of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do I really mean we should give up all testing, finish our edits and just do an svn commit without further ado?  No, of course I mean that we should test our code, step through it in the debugger, examine it, review it, think about it, clean it up and the like.  In fact, I submit that the compelling love of automated testing is precisely a reflection of the fact that while I&amp;#39;m an accomplished professional with a serious work ethic who always debugs and tests his code before checking it in, Other People as we all know are the dreaded perpetrators of Other People&amp;#39;s Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sleight of hand here of course is that Other People are also the dreaded perpetrators of Other People&amp;#39;s Automated Tests.  In my non-day job, rather than getting paid to work on a codebase that has no unit tests, I&amp;#39;m not paid (yet) to work on a project written in Ruby, where automated testing is &amp;quot;baked-right-in&amp;quot;.  Of course, the tests that script/generate will spit out as a by-product of its work all pass, but more importantly, one of the Ruby third party gems I use heavily has sucked up more of its fair share of my time because its tests fail whenever I start running a new version of Ruby or make another change.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just being ornery and jealous of my time that I don&amp;#39;t want to spend the happy part of my coding weekend updating tests that say that a user should end up on page X when they&amp;#39;re finished with some task, after I just explicitly made the change so they&amp;#39;d end up on a page Y?  Really, we need tests to tell us what page people are going to now?  Did we think they&amp;#39;d suddenly start hopping over to pets.com?  And do I care that the string format of a DateTime object changed and now your tests are failing not because the dates are wrong but because of that incidental?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test Driven Development works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Write test case, color should be red.
2) Watch test case fail, color is not red.
3) Write code to make red.
4) Test case passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development Driven Development works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Write code to make red.
2) Verify red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;#39;ve had cases where automated tests have alerted me to real bugs, so I don&amp;#39;t want to damn them out of hand.  But I think a lot of the religious fervor surrounding unit testing boils down to something like this:  &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to step through your code, and I haven&amp;#39;t yet created anything valuable enough that some other poor sap has to step through mine and I can get paid for it while being cursed as a fool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m changing my goal, from writing unit tests for Other People&amp;#39;s Code to just debugging that code as best I can while writing my own code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather be a hammer than a nail.  As the great software engineer, Louis XIV, said, &amp;quot;Other People, C&amp;#39;est Moi!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails Enumerations and Fixtures</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I had to figure out Ruby on Rails enumerations and fixtures today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution will be here in just a moment, but first, some gratuitous background:  I was working on a Person resource -- or a &amp;quot;Contact&amp;quot; resource if you prefer your people to have a CRM flare to them.  Naturally, hanging off of these People (or Contacts) are as many phone numbers as they might have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-first century people have a lot of phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start having contacts who own lots of phones, naturally you want to know if you&amp;#39;re bugging someone to buy your widgets on their cell phone or their home phone or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want to store whole strings to do this, so probably you end up with a line in your schema that looks something like this:
&lt;code&gt;
    t.integer  &amp;quot;phone_type&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s fine, but in your code you don&amp;#39;t want to be saying &amp;quot;p.phone_type = 2&amp;quot;, because that&amp;#39;s not all that readable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ruby doesn&amp;#39;t have enums (BAD language -- just for that you&amp;#39;re going straight to bed with no strong typing, young man).  It does, however, have constants, and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyfleebie.com/enumerations-and-ruby/&quot;&gt;Rails tip&lt;/a&gt; shows you how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like me you may have opted for the simple &amp;quot;first approach&amp;quot; of adding the constants to your model, like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
class Phone &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # Type constants
  HOME = 1
  WORK = 2
  CELL = 3
  # ... more model code ...
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, all that&amp;#39;s well and good, but then what do you do about your fixtures?  Remember, your whole point in starting on this Enumeration journey was to get your code more readable, not less, so if you end up having fixtures that look like this, that&amp;#39;s not a good outcome:
&lt;code&gt;
et_the_extra_terestrial:
  id:                     1
  person_id:        1
  phone_num:     9165551212
  phone_type:     1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone_type:    1&lt;br&gt;
At about this point, I remembered that one of my Rails books said something about dynamic fixtures.  Looking those up, it was easy enough to get ET&amp;#39;s phone looking the way it should in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
et_the_extra_terestrial:
  id:                     1
  person_id:        1
  phone_num:     9165551212
  phone_type:     &amp;lt;%= Phone::HOME %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, Bob&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re uncle, and Drew Barrymore&amp;#39;s your hot aunt.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using Ruby Fixtures at the Console</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At the risk of showing how (not) far I am along the learning curve given my Month of Sundays Rails project, here&amp;#39;s a great beginner sort of   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=11479&quot;&gt;rails tip&lt;/a&gt; I found on how to load fixtures into the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meat of it is this, which I like because it simultaneously shows you how to set up your environment correctly for the console, and for rake.  Not a bad little tutorial for two lines worth of stuff:
&lt;code&gt;
rake db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=test
script/console test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Software At The Speed of Part Time</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on a Rails application, not all the live long day, but generally on a long Friday night and part of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being self-employed during the boom years, now that we&amp;#39;re in a recession I own a real estate company for pin money, and have a full time ecological niche banging on legacy C code in a cube forest.  Following my ancestors, the hunter-gatherers, I am a typer-debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday nights I cut loose from the dusty streets of this one horse Bruce Springsteen song, and do, what exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I hope to get paid for this Rails application eventually, I have to go at it weekend after weekend.  But because I&amp;#39;m not yet getting paid for it yet, and because even if I ever will I&amp;#39;ll be more or less in charge of its direction, I enjoy it as a creative outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of part time takes some getting used to.   Software is one of those things where you start to really get rolling on whatever language it is you happen to be using this year after several weeks of being back in that environment.  Sure, you can be semi-productive on day one, but by week 12 you&amp;#39;re cruising along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say week twelve, though, that&amp;#39;s for a full time gig.  When you get a day of programming per week, then multiply everything by five, given what would have been your five day work week.  So twelve weeks becomes sixty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming at the speed of part time, a six month project takes two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, you have a bit more than a day per weekend you can conceivably put in, but on the minus side, you&amp;#39;re having to keep it all in memory after flushing C through your brain all week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the hardest part of such a project is staying encouraged after four months or so, with a mere few weeks of progress seeming to show for one&amp;#39;s efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing to see how &amp;quot;the economy&amp;quot; changes things.  It seems like all the coffee shops around here are closed.  During the boom years, when one could make a living by blogging alone, I used to go out with all the other high-on-the-hog heloc bailout recipients and enjoy my French roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I went out for my birthday mocha, and my old shop was closed, and the place I would go before I went to my old shop was closed.  To be sure, the coffee shops inside the supermarkets are still doing OK, rescued from collapse by their proximity to the produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any of the old baristas who lost their jobs are now inside Safeway coffee shops, while working on their own chai latte projects on Friday nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Farewell to SlickEdit</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For most men, a mid-life crisis involves either some young bimbo, a motorcycle, or both.  My own midlife crisis is unfolding somewhat differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks, the age of fifty will come out to greet me, as the windshield greets the mayfly.   The local bimbos being unforthcoming, and Harley Davidsons being too noisy, I am learning a new text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, my editor of choice has been Visual SlickEdit, with Brief emulation turned on.  This worked fine for me, especially as long as I was coding web sites for my real estate business and not really feeling myself to be in the Programmer Swing of Things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years when I was in the Programmer Swing of Things, however, I had previously spent hundreds of dollars on SlickEdit upgrades.  I can count no less than seven SlickEdit boxes here in the study, which tells me I&amp;#39;ve been through one Linux version and at least six versions of the Windows product.  So naturally lately when I started to really get into Ruby on Rails, I thought I&amp;#39;d check out what kind of upgrade I&amp;#39;d be eligible for, so I could take advantage of the latest language support feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out I&amp;#39;m not eligible for an upgrade.   The SlickEdit site has a tool where you enter your license number, and the web site says, in effect:  S-U-C-K-E-R!  You want to develop on Linux and Windows and get the latest features after buying seven licenses already?  Sorry, that&amp;#39;ll be six hundred dollars more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not Microsoft, but they&amp;#39;re in the same religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided at this point that VIM was really worth taking another look at.  I&amp;#39;ve used it sporadically over the years, usually when connecting to an ISP on a shell account and needing to get something done in a hurry.  In the last few weeks, I decided to start using it systematically, remembering from my Brief days that after a couple of weeks of pain I&amp;#39;d be liking the world again.  Now I&amp;#39;m up to the point where I&amp;#39;m somewhat competent.  Some things still go too slowly, but I&amp;#39;ve found that if I open up SlickEdit my fingers are already trying to make GVIM work, not Brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Ruby front, Tim Pope&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567&quot;&gt;Vim Ruby Plugin&lt;/a&gt; is a solidly competent free tool for navigating Rails code and getting pretty much anything else done in Rails without resorting to the terminal (unless you happen to feel like resorting to the terminal, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GVIM  works great on Linux, of course, and with a minor wrinkle or two (like using CTRL-Q for &amp;quot;Visual Block&amp;quot; instead of CTRL-V), it works great on Windows, too.   If you find it useful you&amp;#39;re asked to help the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccf-holland.org/&quot;&gt;Ugandan Children&lt;/a&gt;, but outside of that it&amp;#39;s free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my midlife crisis, in its nerdly nutshell.  No harlot, no Harley:  just me and my new editor, which I like very much, and a lot of useless SlickEdit boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Graphical Unit Testing for Ruby on Windows</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I discussed some of the pros and cons of Ruby on Rails versus .NET.  One of my complaints at the time was that Ruby lacks a good graphical unit test runner, because I&amp;#39;m a sucker for a green bar.  I also complained that running tests is cumbersome on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I decided to see if there was a green bar to be had anywhere in the Ruby world, and the answer is this:  well, yes, if you&amp;#39;re running on Linux, and if you&amp;#39;re running Windows, well, sort of.  The good news is that Ruby does have a graphical test runner -- in my case it lives in ruby\lib\ruby\1.8\test\unit\ui\gtk2.  You can learn how to set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows&quot;&gt;Ruby GTK on Windows here&lt;/a&gt;.   Also even though the source clearly wants gtk2, and the web site warns that that&amp;#39;s not fully supported on Windows, it does appear to be working.  I must say the treeview is a lot more primitive than NUnit&amp;#39;s, and you don&amp;#39;t get to see which tests passed -- though of course you get the more important information about which ones failed and where.  And most of all, you get the green bar.  Sweet, beautiful green telling you the world is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in spite of what the docs say about ActiveSupport::TestCase being derived from Object, it&amp;#39;s not -- it&amp;#39;s derived from ::Test::Unit::TestCase as it should be, at least in the code I&amp;#39;m looking at.  Like I said before:  Ruby documentation makes Jesus cry.  And I&amp;#39;m not even religious.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ASP.NET versus Ruby On Rails</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend and college housemate &lt;a href=&quot;http://dimsumthinking.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Daniel Steinberg&lt;/a&gt; stopped by  recently and caught me red-handed in yet another heinous act of last week&amp;#39;s marketing.  By &amp;quot;last week&amp;#39;s marketing&amp;quot;, I mean that I should know better than to say this site is about a specific platform / language/ technology.  This is generally the wrong approach for a computer-linguistic gadabout to take.  John Lockwood putting up a web site about a programming language is like Madonna putting up a web site about her one true love.  The next words out of her mouth are bound to be:  &amp;quot;Woops, no I mean my other one true love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with those other strange bedfellows out of the way, we now turn our attention to a comparison of ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails from my point of view as a fellow without a firm entrenchment in either technology.  This isn&amp;#39;t meant to start or feed a language war because, as I say, I&amp;#39;m not passionately committed to either technology.  I do think that both environments offer a lot that&amp;#39;s good, and both have more than enough things that bug the heck out of me.  So this article quite simply is my list of what I like and don&amp;#39;t like about each environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Like About Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Prototype
*&lt;/em&gt;Rails has excellent baked-in support for two great related JavaScript libraries -- Prototype and Script.acul.us.  It&amp;#39;s about this hard to get started:
&amp;lt;%= javascript&lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt;tag :defaults %&amp;gt;.  Well, OK, it&amp;#39;s a little harder than that, but I found that with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prototypejs.org/api&quot;&gt;Prototype&amp;#39;s beautiful documentation&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to go from zero to productive in a few hours.  What&amp;#39;s more, I actually found myself liking JavaScript for the first time since -- oh, who am I kidding, I always hated it.  Prototype could change my mind, though.  I wrote something that started to look pretty good in Firefox, then fired up Internet Explorer fully expecting half the page to re-materialize in a particle accelerator in Switzerland.  But lo and behold, it worked the way it did in Firefox. You&amp;#39;re kidding, right?  JavaScript did that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I saw her face.  Now I&amp;#39;m a believer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link&lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;remote&lt;/strong&gt;
How easy can we make AJAX?  Does a single function call work for you?  It does for me.  Here&amp;#39;s a tip though from someone who knocked his head briefly against this wall:  unless you&amp;#39;re updating multiple DOM elements (and maybe even if you are), then forget about RJS.  Something in this format:  &amp;quot;your_response.html.erb&amp;quot; is your friend.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Lots of Other Stuff
*&lt;/em&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a Rails programmer, lest I lose the goodwill from the next section, let me say this first: overall, I think Ruby on Rails is the bee&amp;#39;s knees, or perhaps the cat&amp;#39;s pajamas.  Well, either way, it&amp;#39;s something cool that belongs to some critter. I&amp;#39;m not sure I can frame why exactly, but it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun to program in.  There&amp;#39;s something about the way it all fits together that&amp;#39;s very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Don&amp;#39;t Like About Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smugness and Sleight of Hand&lt;/strong&gt;
Rails is an utterly cool framework, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there aren&amp;#39;t parts of it that aren&amp;#39;t either smoke and mirrors or mere social gushiness.  For example, if you have a phrase that goes Don&amp;#39;t Repeat Yourself with the clever acronym of &amp;quot;DRY&amp;quot;, then you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t say it over and over and over and over and over again.  Honestly.  Shut up already.  Even Assembly Language had macros.  We get it.  Give it a REST already.  Oh, and speaking of REST, remember your other catch phrase, You Ain&amp;#39;t Going to Need It?  Well, guess what:  you still have sessions, and so regarding REST, you ain&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What, No Windows?
*&lt;/em&gt;Apparently Rails runs a lot better on Linux than it does on Windows.  I say apparently because I haven&amp;#39;t bitten the bullet yet to set up an Ubuntu partition, but it seems to be the gist of the literature.  I have no reason to doubt it given that as of a couple of weeks ago my no-model unit test framework (which at the time barely beat &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; in terms of complexity) took 13 seconds to load and run.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;You Call This Documentation?
*&lt;/em&gt;Unlike the Prototype documentation (which as I said, is beautiful), the documentation for Rails falls into two categories, as near as I can tell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web pages that link to things that aren&amp;#39;t there any more, as though the framework were trying to bury the competition beneath the sheer weight of 404 errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function documentation that looks something like this:my&lt;em&gt;rails&lt;/em&gt;function(object, gizmo, options = {}, html&lt;em&gt;options = {} )
_object:  some well defined object that the documentation describes in depth
gizmo:  some gizmo that&amp;#39;s also pretty well defined but fairly self evident
blah blah blah lorem ipsit dolor yada yada.
_
Where&amp;#39;s the discussion of &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;html&lt;/em&gt;options&amp;quot;, you ask?  If you&amp;#39;re lucky, they&amp;#39;re somewhere else on the same page, twenty lines down or under the discussion of some related function.  More likely they&amp;#39;re in the source.  Apparently if you&amp;#39;re a Rails programmer, a side benefit of saying Don&amp;#39;t Repeat Yourself over and over is having function parameters handled only in the source and not in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the pros and cons of Rails.  Let&amp;#39;s see if we can come up with some similar virtues and trash talk for Microsoft&amp;#39;s ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Like About ASP.NET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Visual Studio
*&lt;/em&gt;Visual Studio is a competent and mature Integrated Environment, with an outstanding debugger and great features such as code completion.  Now, before you say, &amp;quot;But John, Rails has that, too!&amp;quot;, I should point out that, yes, I tried out RubyMine (in Beta) and Aptana Studio, and so far I&amp;#39;m a bit underwhelmed.  Yes, Chris Williams was totally nice when I entered a bug wherein the code completion didn&amp;#39;t work, and he put a fix in for 1.3.0 within 24 hours of me entering it, and yes I appreciate that.  But 1.3 isn&amp;#39;t out yet, and in Visual Studio, it just works.  Admittedly, Microsoft&amp;#39;s tool has been around a lot longer, and yes, they have huge resources, the comparison is unfair, etc.  But if you&amp;#39;re going to lure me out of Visual SlickEdit and the command line, you&amp;#39;d better have great code completion and an awesome debugger, because otherwise I&amp;#39;m comfortable already.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;MSDN
*&lt;/em&gt;Remember those missing options and html_options from the Rails doc?  Well, if I&amp;#39;m sitting at my keyboard, say &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, give me twenty seconds, and I&amp;#39;ll rattle off all the parameters for CreateWindowEx and what they mean, including acceptable values for multi-valued parameters.  The MSDN documentation for ASP.NET is as good as the Rails documentation is poor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Jobs
*&lt;/em&gt;The last two times I looked, the number of jobs for ASP.NET developers was beating the number of jobs for Ruby on Rails developers by a factor of about 11 to 1.  If you look at the pyramid for Abraham Maslow&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll see that employment (in &amp;quot;Safety&amp;quot;), comes well before Esteem and Self-actualization.  The Beatles presciently wrote about the allure of Rails versus the hegemony of Microsoft thus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your lovin&amp;#39; gives me a thrill
But your lovin&amp;#39; don&amp;#39;t pay my bills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;__*&lt;em&gt;NUnit
*&lt;/em&gt;What can I say.  I&amp;#39;m a tramp for cheap visual thrills.  I like to see the bar turn green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Don&amp;#39;t Like About ASP.NET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;High Cost of Ownership
*&lt;/em&gt;I mentioned jobs before, but in some respects this is a moot point or at least not the only point, since what I have discovered about myself long ago is that the guy I really like working and writing code for is me.  SQLServer and .NET hosting simply don&amp;#39;t have the same sorts of economies as the LAMP world, and I&amp;#39;m sure Rails is on a path to being that cost effective even if it&amp;#39;s not quite there yet.  Thus, to me much of the debate breaks down into a personal decision between entrepreneur versus employee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Vendor Lock
*&lt;/em&gt;As slow as Rails is on Windows, as far as I know the only implementation to date of LINQ to SQL (which one might nickname &amp;quot;ActiveRecord for Microsfoties&amp;quot;) is against SQL Server.  Yes, it&amp;#39;s cool that LINQ works with native objects, XML, and SQL, but to date I haven&amp;#39;t yet needed to do a right outer join of my Employees table and my HttpRequest object, and I don&amp;#39;t anticipate that changing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Their Model View Controller Support is a Disaster
*&lt;/em&gt;This may have changed since I last looked at it, but on my last ASP.NET contract they had an MVC implementation that completely broke browser navigation and was a nightmare to code to.  I&amp;#39;m not an MVC snob, so I&amp;#39;m quite happy with some pages and code behind talking to a well defined model interface if that&amp;#39;s how you want to do things.  However I do think that if you&amp;#39;re going to use the MVC pattern (or any other design pattern), it should work better than the absence of it does.  Rails forces MVC on you, but it works just fine.  MVC is an optional nightmare in ASP.NET, unless your manager is of that all too common variety that prefers buzzwords over common sense -- in which case it becomes a required nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for hanging in there for this completely idiosyncratic view of some of the pros and cons of Ruby on Rails versus ASP.NET.  I&amp;#39;ve barely scratched the surface, I&amp;#39;m sure, but when it comes to language wars, that&amp;#39;s probably all one should do.  In my opinion, programming always represents a certain dynamic tension between &amp;quot;How cool is that?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s cutting me a check this week?&amp;quot;  Go out and code something, folks.  What if they gave a language war and nobody came?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Programmer Fondly Remembers Blogging</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you remember blogging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think when the history of the current economic depression is written, historians are likely to draw a parallel between the bloggers of 2007 (or thereabouts) and the flappers of the roaring twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember blogging? Do you remember having the money to blog? That brings me to my next point: what happened to me, and why am I not blogging any more? The short answer to that is that the money started to go away, so I went and got me a day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know: a day job, with a boss and a 401K and a W2 at the end of the year. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fortunate man to not be unemployed right now. I&amp;#39;m fortunate because I&amp;#39;m self-employed when times are good and -- so far at least, knock keyboard -- I have a day job when times are bad. In my day job I&amp;#39;m back to my old day job of programming software using Microsoft&amp;#39;s Visual Studio. As it happens, the software I&amp;#39;m working on in my day job is a legacy C and C++ Windows codebase. I maintain the database layer, which at times is a proprietary collection of drivers accessing Oracle, ODBC, etc., and at times is just an OLEDB connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the weekends, when I&amp;#39;m not spending ten minutes with my family, I&amp;#39;m working on creating some vertical applications using more recent Microsoft technologies, ASP.NET 3.5, C Sharp 3.0, and LINQ to SQL. One might say, to paraphrase Michael Steele, that I&amp;#39;m bringing my core programming values and applying them to &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blacksnob.com/snob_blog/2009/3/6/michael-steele-ends-hip-hop-urban-to-suburban-campaign.html&quot;&gt;urban-suburban hip-hop settings&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Republican friend at work. Some of my best friends are Republicans. Does saying that make me a racist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize that I don&amp;#39;t have more code to share here yet. I&amp;#39;m too busy writing code to have much time to write about writing code, but I do remember blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Write or Call Your Representative / Senator to Oppose the Paulson Bailout</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how much you&amp;#39;re following the news of the bailout of wall street banks who repackaged bad loans, but if you&amp;#39;re not, now is a great time to get involved and please, please call your elected representative and tell everyone you can about this incredible fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and George Bush are asking Congress for the authority to spend up to &lt;strong&gt;$700 billion&lt;/strong&gt; at a time (that&amp;#39;s a balance sheet maximum, not a maximum on the total the government can spend). That&amp;#39;s more than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zfacts.com/p/447.html&quot;&gt;total cost of the War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; so far. The Treasury will spend it buying bad loans, and get no equity stake in the firms they&amp;#39;re buying them from -- leading some to call it &amp;quot;cash for trash&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section eight of the proposed legislation gives Paulson an oversight-free blank check as to how to spend that much of your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?ref=business&quot;&gt;full text here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although as you might expect, public opposition to the plan is strongest among Democrats, several prominent conservatives have also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html&quot;&gt;gone on record&lt;/a&gt; as being opposed to the plan. This legislation is so bad that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html&quot;&gt;even CNN gets it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please look up and either write to or phone your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/house/MemStateSearch.shtml&quot;&gt;House Representative&lt;/a&gt; right away. You can learn more about the proposal by clicking through on the articles current on Digg for &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/business_finance&quot;&gt;Business and Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress is in a HUGE RUSH to get this done, so those of us who think it&amp;#39;s expensive, ill conceived and leaves us stuck holding the bill need to MOVE NOW to express our concerns to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html&quot;&gt;latest draft the bill&lt;/a&gt;, which I must admit I think is substantially better than Paulson&amp;#39;s original proposal. I wouldn&amp;#39;t go so far as to say this makes me for the bill, but at least it&amp;#39;s moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Drupal Based Business Forum for Greater Sacramento</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I approached &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smyrnavinings.com/&quot;&gt;SmyrnaVining.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Aaron Hofmann to write a post for ParticleWave in our sporadic series, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/strategy.php&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Since then Aaron probably thinks I&amp;#39;ve died and gone to...well, wherever I deserve to go, since I&amp;#39;ve owed him an email for too long about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really must get with him on that to get him over here to talk about his experience implementing what I think is one of the coolest local interest blogs I&amp;#39;ve seen. You see, what Aaron has done is to get a group of local businesses together to create a sort of ultimate closing gift from the donations of this local business community, which he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smyrnavinings.com/area-info/local-businesses/&quot;&gt;promotes heavily&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. The result I think is a very successful combination of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A business referral network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high value promotion for his own business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An excellent community resource for home shoppers and others interested in his area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variations on a Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to create either a Business Forum for Sacramento or a more general portal for some time now, and seeing what Aaron did ramped up my interest in that goal. Rather than add it to my existing Sacramento real estate site, however, I decided to go in a slightly different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I looked at some of the forums and city guides of various kinds that are already out there in Sacramento. Many of the domain names I wanted were already taken, by web sites in various stages of growth and activity, so I finally decided on a slice of the Internet pie that I thought large enough geographically (Greater Sacramento) but narrow enough topically (Businesses). Part of the reason for this business emphasis is that the goal of the site is to network not only for the sake of my real estate business, but also to help spread the word about my web site development business and do some more local business in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of &amp;quot;What the heck will it run on?&amp;quot; I looked at several alternatives. PhpBB is a very popular forum software, but any kind of wider support for blogging or content management is &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; at best. vBulletin comes with good credentials and an optional blogging module, but it&amp;#39;s not free, and given that I don&amp;#39;t always know how successful these projects will be and I&amp;#39;m the guy funding it with, I tend to like free (yes, I know, the money is trivial compared to the time spent, but there it is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Heck is a Drupal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I finally settled on was Drupal, a general purpose, open source content management system. Drupal has the best built in integration for a web site with forums and a blog (or a blog per user, but I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m going there yet). It does a lot of things including user registration and the forums and putting content where you want it reasonably well. The theme interface is very clean compared to Wordpress, and it&amp;#39;s reasonable to do a custom theme in about three files total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, compared to Wordpress, any blogging platform is bound to look somewhat primitive. Setting up a Drupal 6 blog to use Live Writer to post takes a little more work, but it&amp;#39;s pretty much &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/287615&quot;&gt;detailed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, the result has just launched and is in a very early stage, but it&amp;#39;s running and looks somewhat credible: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.SacramentoBusinessForum.com&quot;&gt;SacramentoBusinessForum.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, however, the real community web site devil is in this detail:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just add users!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Wordpress Security Woes</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago all of the Wordpress sites I have hosted on this server were hacked, so I&amp;#39;ve been learning more than I ever wanted to know about Wordpress security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I didn&amp;#39;t lose any data, but it was still an almost two-day pain in the butt to get back to an unhacked state. After seeing what became of many of my files and database entries, I was a bit amazed that Wordpress is as insecure as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several articles go into the sorts of hacks I was dealing with, where PHP code disguised as image files are added to the list of active plugins. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most helpful article was &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/06/08/did-your-wordpress-site-get-hacked/&quot;&gt;Did Your Site Get Hacked&lt;/a&gt;. Why, yes it did. You might also consult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-security-notes&quot;&gt;Wordpress Security Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you simply must see the glass as half full, one of the good things that came out of this was that I have now hardened both my own blogs and those of the clients who are hosted with my blog on my server, and at the same time in order to make maintenance less of a nightmare I&amp;#39;ve consolidated several just-sitting-there blogs into my more popular blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, into each life must fall not just rain, but two days of useless software development aimed at thwarting some malicious moron with a copied exploit script.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Became Of The Houssee Award?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a few weeks since we&amp;#39;ve done a Houssee Award article anywhere, so I thought I&amp;#39;d discuss why in the context of my experiences in launching this yet-another-Digg-clone real estate site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion is fabulously short, really, and my experience boils down to having too high an expectation for what would happen. The premise of the site was that the community of real estate authors would visit the site and vote on their favorite content, and those votes would be the basis of the award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it unfolded, however, very few people were interested in reading or promoting content that wasn&amp;#39;t their own. A few folks did, and I&amp;#39;m grateful to those who did. But the vast majority of users were only interested in promoting their own content. That&amp;#39;s fine, such as it is. It&amp;#39;s certainly one of the reasons Digg based sites are so popular. But as it turned out, there weren&amp;#39;t enough people interested in anyone else&amp;#39;s content to sustain a user-voted award by any reasonable definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying that such a thing won&amp;#39;t miraculously start to happen, and if it does, we can get the award ball rolling again. But I don&amp;#39;t expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Realtor® Trademark Fixer Wordpress Plugin</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you respecting the Realtor® trademark?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;re mad at NAR and you don&amp;#39;t care if you add the trademark symbol or not, but for most of us, we don&amp;#39;t mind (and consider it a lower risk proposition) to go ahead and put the trademark on there.  Realtor®, as you may know, is a registered trademark of the National Association of Realtors®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble for bloggers is that many bloggers don&amp;#39;t know how to type the trademark symbol, and even for those that do, typing that stupid &amp;quot;®&amp;quot; every time is a pain in the neck.  But don&amp;#39;t worry, the plugin makes it simple.  Install it, then go ahead and type the r-word (in either lower case or upper case), and the plugin will automatically correct your usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Installation: *&lt;/em&gt;Just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/RealTrademarkFix.zip&quot;&gt;download the plugin&lt;/a&gt;, unzip it into your Wordpress plugin directory, activate it on the Manage Plugins page, and you&amp;#39;re good to go!  No warranty is provided, including fitness for use.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/RealTrademarkFix.zip&quot;&gt;1.4 Release&lt;/a&gt; (final?) leaves hyphenated forms (realtor-whatever or whatever-realtor) alone.  This is important as we found out because Wordpress permalinks frequently use hyphens, and people couldn&amp;#39;t link to this post.  Now a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/17/the-realtor-trademark-fixer-wordpress-plugin/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; will work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1.3 added the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/RealtorFixPluginTest.php&quot;&gt;Realtor® Fix Plugin Test Page&lt;/a&gt;, which you can visit to see how the plugin will transform your posts.  Because it&amp;#39;s pretty well tested, the plugin offers a simple switch (see the plugin code) for enabling comment filtering if you want.  However, it still ships with comment filtering disabled by default.  This version offers improved matching code, so most URLs with some version of &amp;quot;Realtor®&amp;quot; in them should work well without using the &amp;quot;[sic]&amp;quot; to disable adding the trademark.  However, adding the &amp;quot;[sic]&amp;quot; is still supported.  Finally, this version also offers support for capitalizing the REALTOR® trademark.  Simply type it in all caps (REALTOR®) and it will do the right thing.  If you capitalize the first letter or don&amp;#39;t capitalize anything, you&amp;#39;ll get &amp;quot;Realtor®&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1.2 Release added two features:  First, if you add &amp;quot;[sic]&amp;quot; after the r-word it will suppress adding the trademark (but remove the &amp;quot;[sic]&amp;quot;).  Thus, if you need to link to realtor.com, use http://www.realtor.com.  Secondly, comments are not processed.  A few minutes after I had the plugin installed a user used the r-word in a url, and it was transformed.  Users commenting shouldn&amp;#39;t have to know the rules of use.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Reminder About the Houssee Spam Policy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of wondering who won the Houssee award this week, I&amp;#39;ve spent the last few days playing spam cop. In the hope of not having to do this too often, here&amp;#39;s an unfortunate reminder from our law enforcement division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of vote manipulation, as our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/spam.php&quot;&gt;spam policy&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...if your friend is just you by another name, or if you and your friend have secretly agreed to promote everything for each other regardless of the quality, that crosses the line and becomes spam. Your published posts may sent back to the upcoming queue, or if you persist, your posts or account may be deleted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few users spent quite a bit of time testing out this policy this week, and have discovered that it works. For those of you who didn&amp;#39;t test it out, thank you, and yes I do hate being a cop probably as much as you hate reading about me being one.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Houssee.com Top User Point System - An Insider&#39;s Guide</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of you have probably noticed the *&lt;em&gt;Top Users *&lt;/em&gt;widget that appears on every page of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/&quot;&gt;Houssee.com&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have a competitive streak (I know I do), the first thing you want to know is:  &amp;quot;How can I bump those undeserving people who aren&amp;#39;t me off the top spot and get my very deserving self up there in the limelight?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you poke around in the Top Users page, you may have noticed that the Top Users on the widget are the users who have the highest Karma score.  OK, so far so good, now you know what number you&amp;#39;re shooting for, but what is Karma?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Flies Like An Arrow.  (Fruit Flies Like a Banana)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this is not Karma in the Buddhist sense that you have to make up for the rotten stuff you may have done in a past life.  In fact, what you did in this life won&amp;#39;t help you much, either -- unless you did it recently.  You see, unlike many point systems (ActiveRain&amp;#39;s, for example), Houssee doesn&amp;#39;t much care what you did last month.  We take the history from a shorter period of time -- currently 10 days -- and look at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we may change that number, or tweak the way the system works to be more of a weighted combination of &amp;quot;lifetime achievement&amp;quot; plus &amp;quot;what have you done for Houssee lately&amp;quot;?   But at present, the Top Users widget only goes 10 days back.  Naturally, you still get a benefit from your links being in the system and from the Houssee Awards you may have won, but as far the Top Users widget is concerned, 11 days ago is the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Be a Top User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a top user, basically you have to do more of the following over a ten day period than all but five of your fellow users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Submit Links
*&lt;/em&gt;The most heavily rewarded activity is submitting new content for other people to read.  Naturally most of us are pretty interested in using the system to highlight our own content, but remember the system doesn&amp;#39;t care if you submit a link to your own blog posts or to some news article or blog post you found interesting.  Please keep in mind our spam policy, however -- real estate (broadly considered) only!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment on Other People&amp;#39;s Submissions&lt;/strong&gt;
One of the changes I made to the default (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pligg.com/&quot;&gt;Pligg&lt;/a&gt;) Karma system was to add in a factor for commenting on other people&amp;#39;s submissions.  This is in keeping with the basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/spam.php&quot;&gt;spam-o-phobic&lt;/a&gt; philosophy of Houssee, that even though we&amp;#39;re busy promoting our content and singing the Realtor® musical scale (mi mi mi), we&amp;#39;re also part of a community of other people.  Reading their stuff and commenting on it is a good thing.  (Well, I guess you can debate whether its good or not, but I can guarantee you that it&amp;#39;s part of the Karma algorithm).  You currently get a few less points for doing this than for submitting a link , but much more than you do for the next item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Vote for Submissions
*&lt;/em&gt;Least heavily rewarded by the Karma algorithm -- but nevertheless very quick and easy to do -- is voting for other people.  Is that a cheap way to make the number of votes higher?  Well, yes, I guess it has that effect.  Does it foster a sort of Special Olympics everyone-gets-a-prize mentality?  Yes, I suppose uncharitably one could say that, too.  More to the point, it&amp;#39;s in keeping again with the goal of fostering a real community, one where you get rewarded not only for your individual contributions, but also for recognizing the contributions of others.  Granted that recognition is pretty mechanical in this case, which is why #1 and #2 count so much more heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know most such systems reward &amp;quot;Published&amp;quot; content, and we may get there as more and more users come on board, but for now what you see above is pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your curious, no, the Algorithm doesn&amp;#39;t have a cheat in it that guarantees John Lockwood will be on top.  The fact that I own the domain means I can always throw a link somewhere if I want one, but as far as the Top Users widget code is concerned, I&amp;#39;m competing along with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the tools -- come knock me off that top spot if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And stay tuned for &amp;quot;Houssee Awards, Part Deux: The Re-Houssee-ing.&amp;quot;  Coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Houssee.com Passes One Hundred User Mark (and Other Updates)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, we&amp;#39;re all having a great time on Houssee.  We&amp;#39;re having so much fun that it&amp;#39;s time for an update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks have been stopping by to visit.  Even though we&amp;#39;re only eleven days old we have -- coincidentally enough -- 101 stories submitted or published, and 101 users.  Hey, this makes finding the average easy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve announced our first group of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/06/houssee-real-estate-news-award-winners-1/&quot;&gt;Award Winners&lt;/a&gt;, we have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/shirt.html&quot;&gt;valuable prize&lt;/a&gt; for them to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a written &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/spam.php&quot;&gt;Spam Policy&lt;/a&gt;.  Don&amp;#39;t Do It.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have our very own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/tag/housseecom/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (OK, so I admit it, technically it&amp;#39;s a Wordpress tag on ParticleWave&amp;#39;s very own blog -- but that&amp;#39;s fun, too).  Hey look, you&amp;#39;re reading it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/HousseecomRealEstateNews/UpcomingNews&quot;&gt;FeedBurner Feed&lt;/a&gt; so you can keep track of the latest Houssee submissions.  So far we&amp;#39;re feeding the submissions rather than the publications, but that may change soon when I announce the new algorithm for the top user sidebar.  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fixed an obscure technical problem, and got grouchy with a guy who was stubborn about it.  It&amp;#39;s probably not interesting to you, but if you like obscure technical problems or seeing me grouchy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/07/problem-using-option-2-search-engine-friendly-urls-using-htaccess-in-pligg-with-fix/&quot;&gt;read about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/houssee/&quot;&gt;MyBlogLog account&lt;/a&gt; for Houssee.  Don&amp;#39;t look now, but your head is showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Problem Using Option 2 Search Engine Friendly URLs using htaccess in Pligg, With Fix</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For most of my usual real estate readers, this post will be pretty technical and you may want to skip it. It deals with a fix I found in working on Houssee.com, and it has a sort of Dilbert-like appeal to those of you who&amp;#39;ve ever worked on a software team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I eventually left software is the inordinate amount of time we used to spend making the case that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;define BROKEN true&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should be changed to   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;define BROKEN false&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually there&amp;#39;s some vague sociological reason for leaving the first line in, like a manager who found a consultant who told him it should be that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case the reason is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I Know More About Apache Than YOU Do, Neener Neener Neener&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are still struggling to get &amp;quot;Option 2&amp;quot; search engine friendly URLs to work in Pligg using .htaccess, you can take comfort in the fact that the developers over there know more about Apache than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But meantime enjoy the fix below! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JohnLockwood &lt;img src=&quot;http://forums.pligg.com/images/chestnut/statusicon/user_online.gif&quot; alt=&quot;JohnLockwood is online now&quot;&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys,   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I found the fix for this. Unless anyone knows of a reason why it shouldn&amp;#39;t be included, I suggest the developers roll it into the code and see if it doesn&amp;#39;t save a lot of people grief in the next release.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In .htaccess, find the line that reads:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options +Indexes +FollowSymlinks   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change it to this:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options +Indexes +FollowSymlinks -MultiViews   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem in a nutshell is that depending on how Apache is configured, ^upcoming/... (for example) never fires off the rewrite rule, but instead resolves to upcoming.php?/....   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix above solved it for my host (kattare.com), and now option 2 is running brilliantly.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MultiViews has always been an issue.. It&amp;#39;s not listed in the requirements because most servers don&amp;#39;t use it.. There is no way we can make a list of requirements of things &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who said anything about listing it in the requirements? If your code DEPENDS on the thing being turned off, and you know that, and the fix is easy, then one would think that someone with source code access who cares about having a quality product that works for as many installed users as possible would take a minute to add the 1/3 of a line of code that it takes to turn it off. If it was off to begin with, fine, no harm done, it&amp;#39;ll still be off. If it was on to begin with, the &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot; will now be a &amp;quot;non-issue&amp;quot; because the &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; will be &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and there&amp;#39;s no way I can make a list of all the bugs there are in your code. Mostly I find it fairly robust, and I&amp;#39;m not trying to sound ungrateful, but I stubbed my toe hard on this one, and I&amp;#39;m not the first one, hence the thread. I sent you the fix. Here it is again: Add -MultiViews to the Options line in .htaccess. If you&amp;#39;d rather show off how much more you know about Apache configuration than your users than have a product that works in as many environments as possible, leave it broken.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Houssee.com adds &quot;Top User&quot; Feature</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strike&gt;threatened&lt;/strike&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/03/promote-your-real-estate-blog-on-housseecom/&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ve added a sidebar widget for the top user links to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houssee.com/&quot;&gt;Houssee.com&lt;/a&gt;, the Internet&amp;#39;s best 100% Spam-free (famous last words) Pligg-based real estate publish-and-vote-for-your-news Digg clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How come only Jay Thompson and I are top users? Short answer, because only Jay and I are the intrepid first adopter and admin, respectively, who submitted one or more stories and added a URL to our profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are interested in the hitherto unpublished details of the Brain-Dead-Algorithm (tm) -- subject to change without notice, but not too soon -- here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you enter a URL in your profile? Did you submit at least one story? If so, you&amp;#39;re totally the golden-boy (-girl) with a front page link. When there get to be &amp;gt; 6 of us, the people with URLs who&amp;#39;ve submitted the most stories will be the Top Users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Houssee.com top user will increase your geek credentials tremendously, though not as much as rolling your own Linux install or coding with a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit early. Vote often. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Review of RealEstateVoices.com</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatevoices.com/&quot;&gt;RealEstateVoices.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is a place where you can submit and vote on blog posts or other real estate related news. The site runs on the open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digg.com&quot;&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; clone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pligg.com&quot;&gt;Pligg&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since, I&amp;#39;ve been submitting several articles of my own and from other people&amp;#39;s sites that I like, and inviting a few friends to check it out. Here&amp;#39;s my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatevoices.com/story/title/A_Review_of_RealEstateVoices-com&quot;&gt;link back&lt;/a&gt; to this article -- careful you don&amp;#39;t trip on the recursion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I&amp;#39;m a bit sore because I didn&amp;#39;t put up a site like this several months ago, when I first had the idea for a digg-like real estate site. Actually, my idea for a site was a little bit different, so there may still be a niche to explore, since what I was looking to do was more like a cross between Digg and the Carnival of Real Estate. There would be a weekly award like the Carnival, but the selections for who won each week would be vote-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even started coding some of this back in January, before I knew that Pligg existed. Unfortunately I got distracted by other projects, and now my idea is just an idea with a little bit of user signup code, and there&amp;#39;s Pligg out there, and there&amp;#39;s RealEstateVoices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I congratulate the publishers of RealEstateVoices.com for getting there first. Overall it&amp;#39;s very easy to get started -- you simply sign up (which only takes a few seconds) and start submitting stories. Stories that get voted on are published, and presented more prominently than those that are simply submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, here&amp;#39;s my page of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatevoices.com/user/view/published/login/JohnLockwood&quot;&gt;Published Stories&lt;/a&gt; and here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatevoices.com/user/view/shaken/login/JohnLockwood&quot;&gt;stories I&amp;#39;ve submitted&lt;/a&gt; that no one has voted on yet. But don&amp;#39;t be afraid -- I don&amp;#39;t mind if you vote for my submissions! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news about RealEstateVoices is that it&amp;#39;s an easy to use way to get some reasonably relevant-to-real-estate links to your blog. The bad news about RealEstateVoices is that the publishers simply are not keeping up on the spam there. So you can read about real estate, to be sure, but Google has also indexed sixty-six articles from Pligg about enlarging your penis -- but, ironically enough given that many real estate professionals are women -- only about fifteen articles about enlarging your breasts. Browsing RealEstateVoices, you&amp;#39;ll also find lots of links to laptop batteries, cheap hotels, wedding favors -- and all sorts of irrelevant claptrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can click the &amp;quot;Report Spam&amp;quot; link on as much as you want, seemingly in vain. It never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my main complaint about RealEstateVoices. The social network and user profile functionality are pretty minimalist, but that&amp;#39;s not such a big deal. But the Spam really gets in the way of this tool&amp;#39;s usefulness. The other big problem is that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to get the search tool to work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to work with Pligg a little bit and see how the latest Beta&amp;#39;s doing. I imagine my original idea would be much easier to do as an integration on top of this existing code. Of course, then the guy having to make sure the spammers get stopped would be me. There are ways to approach this -- the latest Beta has more spam fighting tools built in, and one could always make the site invitation-only to help combat spam. The outstanding question would be whether users would show up given that there&amp;#39;s already a well established contender.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>WordPress Woes</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been upgrading some of my blogs to WordPress 2.5, and the results have not been pretty. The mistakes I&amp;#39;ve been making along the way are pretty amateurish ones, but I&amp;#39;m professional enough to make my amateurish mistakes first on low priority blogs of my own rather than on one of my important blogs or on a client&amp;#39;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly what I&amp;#39;ve been bumping into is deleting my backups prematurely. Don&amp;#39;t do that. Backup everything, and keep everything for a week until you find out what the upgrade broke. That way you&amp;#39;ll keep your old &amp;quot;wp-content&amp;quot; directory, and the &amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; directory off of that, which (unless you changed the setting for this) contains all the images that Windows Live Writer uploaded automatically for you over the course of the months, ever since you went through my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/20/windows-live-writer-tutorial/&quot;&gt;Windows Live Writer tutorial&lt;/a&gt; video -- for example. (Ironically, the image link to that tutorial was one of the images I lost, so I just had to re-create it. Live by the sword, die by the sword, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re going to do an upgrade, I recommend you start by reading Lorelle van Fossen&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogherald.com/2008/03/07/wordpress-upgrade-preparation-checklist/&quot;&gt;Upgrade Preparation Checklist&lt;/a&gt;. And then where Lorelle says Backup Everything, you might substitute: &amp;quot;Backup everything, and then don&amp;#39;t be an idiot and delete it right away once things are up and running -- do extensive testing over several weeks and then delete the backups.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Blogging Basics Part 3 of 3 — Launch Checklist</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So far in our Twenty-One Days to a Better Blog Series (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/11/twenty-one-days-to-a-better-blog/&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/series/21DaysTableOfContent.php&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;), we&amp;#39;ve been talking about elements of your blog that you usually work on when your blog is still young, such as what platform it will be running on.  We also talked about how your domain name, title, tagline, and theme will work together to let your reader know right away that your blog is one that they&amp;#39;ll want to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I want to walk you through three more things that I always do when a blog is just a little infant, before I start happily typing away.  Together with the tasks we&amp;#39;ve already talked about, these tasks make up a kind of launch checklist for a new blog.  Even if you&amp;#39;re new to these three tasks, getting through them should only take a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Override the Default PermaLink Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you blog, you have a blog home page as well as pages that represent categories, archives of past blogs, and individual posts.  The links to the individual posts are called PermaLinks.  As the name suggests, you don&amp;#39;t want to be changing how these work late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Wordpress PermaLinks are &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; URLs that are not very descriptive, and will look something like http://www.yourdomain.com/?p=123.  To change this, go into the &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; tab of the Wordpress control panel, and select &amp;quot;PermaLinks&amp;quot;.  Generally, I check the &amp;quot;Day and Name&amp;quot; radio button, which will give you a structure that includes the name in the URL of the post, thus (for example):  http://www.yourdomain.com/2008/04/14/my-first-post.  Such a &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; URL makes more sense both to a human reader and a search engine, though admittedly it loses brevity compared to the dynamic version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn a Feed Using FeedBurner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another task that you&amp;#39;ll want to do early on is to &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; a feed using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/&quot;&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt;. FeedBurner, now owned by Google, is a popular site that helps you do things like tracking statistics for your RSS feed.  It also helps you make your feed available to people using different readers.  I&amp;#39;ve found FeedBurner very easy to use, so you should be able to follow the directions there to get your feed burned relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your FeedBurner feed published, if you&amp;#39;re running Wordpress I recommend installing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8d-design.com/blog/2006/01/26/are-you-funnelling-all-your-subscribers-through-feedburner/&quot;&gt;Feedburner Wordpress Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.  In brief, what this plugin does is it redirects people who find the default Wordpress theme to your FeedBurner feed, so that your FeedBurner statistics better reflect everyone who&amp;#39;s visiting your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I consider using FeedBurner to be an &amp;quot;early in the life of a blog&amp;quot; task is that many blog directories want to have a URL of a feed to work with, so I like to point them to the FeedBurner version of the feed from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn On Spam Filtering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with Comment SPAM manually is a pain, and I have had excellent luck on Wordpress with either &lt;a href=&quot;http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/&quot;&gt;SpamKarma2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://akismet.com/&quot;&gt;Akismet&lt;/a&gt;.  I think that of the two, Akismet is a better choice going forward, since it is slightly easier to configure correctly.  In fact, there&amp;#39;s not much to it beyond activating the plugin and entering a Wordpress API Key (which you can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://faq.wordpress.com/2005/10/19/api-key/&quot;&gt;more information about here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Blog Basics Part 2 of 3: Theme, Title, Tagline</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we continue the discussion of some of the most basic elements of a good blog that we began in our article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/14/blogging-basics-platform-hosting-domain/&quot;&gt;Blogging Basics:  Platform, Hosting, Domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got your blog up and running by finding a place to host it and pointing a domain to it, you&amp;#39;re now ready to focus on several key elements that will help a new visitor decide in about fifteen seconds or less whether or not to spend any time and attention on your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pressure, though!  (No really, no pressure -- you can always make a change later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the the theme, logo, title, and tagline of your blog make up your visitor&amp;#39;s first impression of what your blog is about and whether your blog is interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take each element in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Wordpress Theme is a skin or template that defines the look and feel of your blog.  There are thousands of free themes available.  Some of the top sites for browsing Wordpress themes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.wordpress.net/&quot;&gt;Wordpress Theme Viewer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpthemesfree.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress Themes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wpthemepark.com&quot;&gt;The Wordpress Theme Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the free themes, there are many, many vendors selling premium themes or services customizing the theme for you.  Customizing a theme requires some basic PHP / HTML skills that you may not have, so you may prefer to have a Wordpress expert assist you with changes you may need to make.  If that&amp;#39;s the case, you may consider hiring someone to take an existing, &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; theme and extend it for you (I have done this sort of work for clients myself and it has worked out well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you may need someone to help you with your theme design (initially and from time to time), I believe the need for a unique look and feel can be overrated.  Although I customize my own blog themes heavily (because I can), this is not something I would probably invest heavily in if I couldn&amp;#39;t do it myself.  To be sure, you want to pick out an existing theme that&amp;#39;s not the Wordpress default theme or something equally hackneyed.  Beyond that, your theme should be simple, based on a white background, and have a layout that supports what you want to do .  For example, if you&amp;#39;re selling ads, you&amp;#39;ll need to think about where they&amp;#39;ll go.  My philosophy is that a bad theme may drive a user away, but a great theme isn&amp;#39;t going to keep them there more than a few minutes if your content is awful.  Get something halfway decent looking, and start writing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Title and Tagline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the General Options page of your Wordpress blog, the two first choices you&amp;#39;ll make are the Blog Title and Tagline.  Your Blog Title is the name of your blog, and is the text that will show up in the title bar of your home page.  You can think of this as either your main brand or your main keyword combination that you would like to appear in the search engines.  (I mean it when I say main keyword combination -- pick a phrase that tells both a human reader and a search engine what your blog is about.  This should not be a Sears catalog of possible keywords).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your tagline allows you to embellish this basic title with more information about what your blog is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some basic guidelines to follow when you pick your title and tagline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Keep it simple.  *&lt;/em&gt;Can a reader look at it and tell you what your blog is about within five seconds or less?  If they can&amp;#39;t, then your title or tagline are too confusing.  Use concise, concrete language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Match your blog.  *&lt;/em&gt;Your title and tagline should match what your blog&amp;#39;s really doing, and what you&amp;#39;re trying to sell.  For example, most of my posts so far have been Pro Blogging or Online Publishing, but I still have &amp;quot;Freelancing&amp;quot; in the tagline because a potential client may want to hire a &amp;quot;Freelance Writer&amp;quot;, not an &amp;quot;Online Publisher&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Consider including your domain.  *&lt;/em&gt;Not everyone will subscribe the first time they visit, so having your URL (which should also be descriptive) somewhere in the title may help a visitor remember how to get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t apologize.  *&lt;/em&gt;The default Wordpress tagline is &amp;quot;Just another Wordpress Blog&amp;quot;.  Not only should you change this, you should change it so it no longer has the word &amp;quot;Just&amp;quot; in it.  Your blog tagline should not be &amp;quot;Just the ramblings of a geek&amp;quot;, for example.  Why would I read that?  If you change it to &amp;quot;All the things a geek needs to read&amp;quot; -- now that&amp;#39;s something people will read.  Well, geeky people, anyway -- but that&amp;#39;s not a bad population for a blog to target!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Change is not the end of the world.  *&lt;/em&gt;Did you start out trying to be the definitive source for everything automotive, but then ended up spending 90% of your time writing about Hybrid engines?  Go ahead and modify your tagline and title to match what you&amp;#39;re really doing.  Although you shouldn&amp;#39;t change them capriciously, your title and tagline are as much subject to periodic review and improvement as any other element of your blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo or Title?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, most themes will display your title and tagline for you without further customization.  One of the custom options your theme developer might discuss with you, however, is the ability to put an image logo in place of -- or in addition to -- the title on the page itself, while still showing the title in the title bar of your main page.  Either choice is fine.  SEO purists will insist on having the &lt;h1&gt; with the title of the blog on the page, but a well designed logo that reiterates your domain name may be a better choice from a branding perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Blogging Basics:  Platform, Hosting, Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Day one of our series about Building a Better Blog in Twenty-One Days was an introduction to what we&amp;#39;d be working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my readers -- maybe 90% -- can go ahead and skip over today&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Day Two&amp;quot; installment about blogging platform, web hosting, and domain name.  That&amp;#39;s fine.  Go out and have a cigarette if you want.  I won&amp;#39;t be offended.  This is like the deceptively easy first day of review in math class before the hard work begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven&amp;#39;t yet started a blog and are wondering where to begin, however, I&amp;#39;m going to just dive right in and share my religion with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Blog Should Be Running On WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I&amp;#39;ve said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve already launched your blog on Blogger or TypePad, and you&amp;#39;re happy with it, that&amp;#39;s great.  Most of the rest of the series will be non-Wordpress-specific, so you should stay with us in spite of this dogmatic beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you haven&amp;#39;t already started a blog, then your blog needs to be running on Wordpress.  Here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a budget of no money at all, and you&amp;#39;re just experimenting and start writing and have some fun, you can get a free Wordpress.com blog.  I have one, just for the fun of it.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/features/&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;.  If your work takes off and you need to export it later, you can do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the middle of your blogging journey, and want more control over the code you run on your Wordpress blog, you can get a free copy of the open source Wordpress product and run it on any one of a zillion low cost web hosts for about $7.00 per month.  Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/hosting/&quot;&gt;list of some of these hosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former software developer, I appreciate the fact that with a huge number of third party software plugins, Wordpress does about 99% of what I ever needed it to do.  The other 1% I can code myself.  Yes, their upgrades can be a bit quirky sometimes, but for the most part Wordpress is incredibly good software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Need Your Own Domain Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about $10 per year or less through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com&quot;&gt;Godaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;, having your own domain name is one of the cheapest things someone on the Internet is going to insist you break down and buy.  Your domain is your first attempt to give your visitor an idea about what your blog is going to be about, so picking a good name helps you with the goal we set for ourselves at the outset of being clear.  A good domain name should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relate to what the site&amp;#39;s about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be as short as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not infringe on any copyright / trademark or the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought InkLit.com was a cute name and a bit of a paradox for an Internet Writing site.  It&amp;#39;s also nice and short, but it&amp;#39;s not especially descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ProBlogger.com&amp;quot; is great -- it&amp;#39;s short, and tells you what the site is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Writing-Journey.com&amp;quot;:  very nice, but Bob needed the hyphen because the unhyphenated form was taken.  I have &amp;quot;Sacramento-Home.com&amp;quot; on another site for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of really good domain names will be taken, but there are still some tasty nuggets to be found.  I just registered &amp;quot;TechReview360.com&amp;quot; the other day.  You can use the domain search tool available at Godaddy to research what&amp;#39;s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re at this stage with your blog, you may want to think about your domain name in connection with our next post in the series about some of the other basic elements of your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Twenty-One Days To A Better Blog</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What does having a better blog mean to you?  Does it mean a big four or five-digit subscriber count?  How about a steady stream of people who start commenting on your posts almost as soon as they hit your site?  Do you want more page views because more page views means more advertising revenue, or are you content with capturing a smaller, focused niche in the search engines to help you sell your product or service?  Do you want to convert more of your visitors to closed sales, or are you simply trying to reach a larger audience with your message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your exact goals, I want to welcome you to this new article series, Twenty-One Days to a Better Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is day one.   That means of course that we&amp;#39;ll have twenty more posts in the series.  However, by way of warning up front, I may take a day or two off as we go along, especially on weekends.  Also, I may write a post from time to time that&amp;#39;s not part of the series.  All in all, however, I think you&amp;#39;ll find that navigating around in the series will be pretty easy.  (In fact, if you&amp;#39;re curious, I&amp;#39;ll share with you how to set up such a series when we get to the day entitled &amp;quot;Write an Article Series&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll also be writing about a number of different things you can try on your blog.  Some of these you may only need to do once, and they may take you a lot less time than a day.  So don&amp;#39;t be surprised if you still have to write your blog and work on some of these after the twenty-one days are up.  Nevertheless, I&amp;#39;m going to try to structure this in such a way that if you try out the suggestions I write about, your blog should be better at the end of twenty-one days than it was at the beginning, and so that you can continue to improve from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do We Mean By &amp;quot;Better?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked you the questions above about what you think a better blog is, and now it&amp;#39;s fair at the outset of the series that I share with you a little bit about my background, what I mean by a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; blog, and where I intend to end up.  Also I want to lay out some of the territory we&amp;#39;ll be exploring so you have a way to think about the rest of the posts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the background first.  For many years now, I&amp;#39;ve been blogging in a small niche (real estate in the Sacramento area).  In fact, I was the founder and am still the co-author of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events&quot;&gt;oldest real estate blog in Sacramento&lt;/a&gt;.  In that blog, I haven&amp;#39;t focused much on building my subscriber audience, since most people care about real estate when they&amp;#39;re about to buy or sell a house, and the subset of those who care about a particular geographical area is fairly small.   Because of this, my focus was on reaching people when they were searching for real estate, and having a following was less important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when I started Inklit, I realized that the topic of &amp;quot;Internet Writing&amp;quot; had a much larger potential audience, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;building a subscriber base&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first things I wrote about.  And sure enough, this month-old blog already has more than half the subscribers of my almost five-year-old real estate blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I bring this up is that I&amp;#39;m going to give a definition of better, but I want to stress at the outset that not every blogger is the same -- and even for a single blogger, the definition is going to vary according to what project you&amp;#39;re working on.  So as you stay cooped up with me for the next twenty days, I want you to be thinking about how -- and whether -- this definition applies to you.  The other reason I bring this up is to set the tone as fellow traveler on this journey with you -- in fact, as often as possible, I&amp;#39;ll be demonstrating the techniques I&amp;#39;ll be writing about here so you can get an idea of what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Blog is Better If...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It makes more money.  *&lt;/em&gt;Feel free to ignore this if your blog is strictly personal and you don&amp;#39;t care about making money.  If you do care about making money, then more is generally considered a better quantity of money than less.  (Check with a Harvard MBA on that, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is clear.&lt;/strong&gt;  I recently wrote about the debate between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/07/blogging-tips-many-topics-versus-few-topics/&quot;&gt;specialists and generalists&lt;/a&gt;, and in that post, I argued that the specialists won.  People like to subscribe to resources that they think will educate or entertain them in a certain way.  So having unity of theme is one way for a blog to be clear.  Other elements of clarity include a clean and easy to understand layout, simple navigation elements, and outstanding writing.  In the case of elements that will lead a visitor to buy from you, ease of ordering also feeds back into item 1, making more money.  The same is true for other things you might want a visitor to do, like subscribing.  See the next point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It has more readers.   *&lt;/em&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t care about how much money you make, you still want someone to read you -- otherwise your haikus or whatever would be in a notebook in your desk.  If you do care about making money, then, depending on your business model, you may need a lot of people reading you to make any money at all.  Even the most jaded SEO practitioner -- more concerned with how computers view their writing than people how people do -- want readers because readers might link to them!  We can measure readers in a number of ways, unique visitors, page views, subscriber counts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Are We Going To Get There?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I look over the list of topics we&amp;#39;ll be digging into, it occurs to me that they fall into two broad groups or categories, the &amp;quot;me, myself, and my keyboard&amp;quot; group, and the &amp;quot;get by with a little help from my friends&amp;quot; group.  That is to say, there are tasks you could in principle do all by yourself (though for some people who are less technical, some of the technical tasks may require some help from your web guy).  Then there are tasks which by their nature mean you need others to help you, so we&amp;#39;re going to be learning about building a sphere of influence and social networking.  You can think of this as &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;development&amp;quot; tasks versus &amp;quot;marketing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;promotion&amp;quot; tasks.  There are some tasks, though, that straddle both worlds, where community and content come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, our definition of a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; blog breaks down the same way.  You can make your blog more clear, and it will be clear whether you read it or a million people do.  But you can&amp;#39;t get to a million readers or a million dollars without the involvement of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Us For The Rest Of The Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not already a subscriber, I would like to invite you to subscribe to this blog (in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=1751901&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;) too get the whole series as it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ad Contest Winner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/11247388@N00/2360810530/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2303/2360810530_e35bc99b02_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased to announce that -- subject to someone beating him by June 10th according to the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise_contest.php&quot;&gt;contest rules&lt;/a&gt; -- Bob Younce of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.writing-journey.com&quot;&gt;The Writing Journey&lt;/a&gt; is the winner of our ad contest.  Bob wins the 125 x 125 pixel banner ad at the right for six months, for the traffic and subscribers that came as a result of his submission of my site to StumbleUpon, and for otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/writing-around-the-web-april-2-2008&quot;&gt;making an effort&lt;/a&gt; to promote the contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that Bob won subject to the original rules because according to the way the contest was originally framed, I reserved the right to post the winning ad on June 10th if I hadn&amp;#39;t gotten to my goal of 101 subscribers by today, April 10th.  As of today I&amp;#39;m up to 67 subscribers, so I&amp;#39;m officially two thirds of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you could still win this contest if you are some well known blog A-lister and you wrote a glowing review about me and pointed people to the original contest rules and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;Eleven Steps&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all of you A-Listers who are hanging on my every word, now&amp;#39;s your chance to win a foot race against Bob Younce!  I&amp;#39;ll bet you can&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Cronin of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realesetatetomato.com&quot;&gt;Real Estate Tomato&lt;/a&gt; gets an honorable mention as the early favorite in the contest, after publishing a guest post of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone else who participated as well by inviting me to do a guest post or promoting me on FaceBook or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting tomorrow we&amp;#39;ll have a brand new series, 21 Days to a Better Blog.  Watch for it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Twitter versus CatalystBlogger</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Son of Freelance Face-Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Chris Knight over at EZineArticles &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ezinearticles.com/2008/04/vigorous-writing-freelance-face-off.html&quot;&gt;took notice&lt;/a&gt; of my original Freelance Face-Off between Associated Content and EZineArticles. Michelle Devon had this to say about Freelance Face-Off classic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hummm, I write for both AC and EzineArticles, and I see them as two completely different animals and wouldn&amp;#39;t have ever thought to compare them, because they are so radically different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s that you say? Apples and oranges? Man, that&amp;#39;s it. The rhetorical gauntlet has been thrown down, and you know how I get in the presence of a down thrown gauntlet of a rhetorical nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Got Your Apples and Oranges Right Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, seriously, Michelle, it&amp;#39;s all good, especially since our conversation made me think to compare those true apples and oranges, CatalystBlogger and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;CatalystBlogger&lt;/a&gt; is Jennifer Williamson&amp;#39;s excellent Freelance Writing Blog that I recommended &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/12/jennifer-williamson-freelance-writing-blog/&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. Its main characteristic is thoughtful, clear writing about interesting Freelancing topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is the social networking _debutante du jour. _Love me, she cries, for I am still young and interesting. Its main characteristic is that you have 140 characters to get your message across, which everyone is doing, incessantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So What&amp;#39;s The Relationship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have thought to compare CatalystBlogger and Twitter, except that today I was working on an article series that was going to mention Twitter, and I happened to check my traffic logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an interesting section from them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say I &amp;quot;happened to check&amp;quot; my traffic logs, but I&amp;#39;ll let you in on a little secret. That&amp;#39;s like an alcoholic saying &amp;quot;I happened to be enjoying a beer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stop checking my traffic logs. I need professional help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twelve Hits From Twitter Versus Thirteen From CatalystBlogger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you serious?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As good as Jennifer Williamson&amp;#39;s blog is, no one would dispute that Twitter has gotten more attention. In terms of Google references, Twitter is approximately 1,000 times more popular than CatalystBlogger. Yet in terms of recognition for Inklit, my participation on Twitter has gotten me not only nothing particularly worth reading, but one less web site hit than Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being Visible Is Not Being Interesting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a difference between being visible and being interesting. Twitter is visible. CatalystBlogger is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I got more traffic from Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog than I got from Twitter even though Twitter is 1,000 times more visible is that the people reading Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog are looking for something interesting to read, so they click through to my blog (only to discover that I&amp;#39;m not as interesting as Jennifer -- but what the heck, I get the benefit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Jennifer&amp;#39;s readers, the people on Twitter are interested in being visible, and telling people they&amp;#39;re in the shower now, or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Twit.&amp;quot; That should have been a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present company included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is There a Moral Here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are several of them. I&amp;#39;m running a special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being around people who are interesting is worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting on other people&amp;#39;s blogs can be a more effective traffic building &amp;quot;technique&amp;quot; than hanging around on Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be interesting, and visibility will follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweeting is for the birds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendship doesn&amp;#39;t abide your 140 character limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a new debutante in six months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Blogging Tips:  Many Topics Versus Few Topics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/32397729@N00/2297179486/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/2297179486_2089e1c8d1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_4156&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/photo_dropper/images/cc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/32397729@N00/2297179486/&quot;&gt;joshuamckenty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a dedicated blogger and someone who has more than one interest in life, sooner or later you may be haunted by the issue of how many blogs you should have.    That&amp;#39;s the position I find myself in now.  To give you an idea of how much I&amp;#39;m wrestling with this issue, today at lunch I was doing a balance sheet of the pros and cons of using an existing blog and widening it to several topics, versus spinning off yet another blog that I&amp;#39;m not sure I have time for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s so on my mind these days, I was very interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abundancehighway.com/taking-the-abundance-highway-to-new-heights/&quot;&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Suzie Cheel&amp;#39;s blog, which is about the pros and cons of having a narrowly focused, single-topic blog versus having a wide ranging blog with many topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of the Bloggers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks weighed in on Suzie&amp;#39;s blog, and I was hoping some of my readers might also want to discuss it here.  One of the first things I did in going over it was look at who was arguing for and against specialization, and how well that model seems to be serving them.  On the specialist side of the argument was ProBlogger author Darren Rowse (In fact, I learned about the discussion because Darren &lt;a href=&quot;www.problogger.net/archives/2008/04/05/how-many-topics-should-a-blog-cover/&quot;&gt;linked to it&lt;/a&gt;).  Taking the generalist approach was an author that Suzie Cheel cited in her original post, John Pozadzides.  John believes strongly enough in the case for blog generalization that the tag line of his blog is &amp;quot;Specialization is for Insects&amp;quot;, part of a Heinlein quote that John gives in more detail in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://onemansblog.com/about/&quot;&gt;About Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging into the numbers for both authors, I noticed that John had about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aonemansblog.com&quot;&gt;3,700 pages indexed&lt;/a&gt; by Google and 1,045 Feedburner subscribers as of today.  He also posted a figure of an average of 15,000 to 20,000 page views daily.  The ratio of page views to subscribers in his case is approximately 17:1, which is about what it is on Inklit, where I have 1,072 page views daily and 57 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing Darren&amp;#39;s numbers to John&amp;#39;s, what struck me immediately is that Darren had less than twice as many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aproblogger.net&quot;&gt;pages indexed by Google&lt;/a&gt; (5,260), yet he had about forty-two times as many subscribers.  I don&amp;#39;t know Darren&amp;#39;s page view numbers, but I estimate them at something over a half million daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s Not The Result I Wanted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that Heinlein quote about specialization.  I really wanted to have a blog about everything -- in fact, as of yesterday, I had decided that that&amp;#39;s was where I was heading, and this morning I was taking the first steps in that direction, and was pretty much prepared to make the frightening announcement that Inklit was about to be devoured by my growing Borg Collective!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have no fear.  I am a specialist again.  This is a blog about Writing on the Internet.  Pay no attention to those digressions about Wordpress Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers, What Do You Think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments?  Do you specialize?  If you generalize, do you do it in more than one place?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Wordpress Plugin to Increase Subscribers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/85985940@N00/75687093/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/36/75687093_81509fa28a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;295&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wrote my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;101 Subscribers in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt; post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minnesotainvestmentrealestate.com/&quot;&gt;Minnesota Investment Property&lt;/a&gt; specialist Scott Ficek was good enough to comment on on the post and recommend the &amp;quot;What Would Seth Godin Do&amp;quot; plugin, so I could get a nice-sized subscriber base like the one shown at right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, thank you to Scott and I hope he&amp;#39;s right that this plugin works well, lest I have my clothes sold off by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/04/so-many-blogs-so-little-blogger/&quot;&gt;pregnant teenage chain smokers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(No, that&amp;#39;s not a bid to go after some of the wrong kind of traffic, but I&amp;#39;ll bet I get it anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I appreciate Scott&amp;#39;s participation and suggestion, I must admit that I almost didn&amp;#39;t make it past the name on this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that people who need someone to follow are stoned in love with the bald one, but many of us could care less what Seth Godin would do.  I would have called it the &amp;quot;New Visitor Welcome Plugin&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Convert New Visitors to Subscribers&amp;quot; plugin.  That way when people are wondering how to convert new visitors, they&amp;#39;d find the plugin.  But that&amp;#39;s just me.  I appreciate Richard Miller writing it, and if you&amp;#39;re going to contribute good code to the community I guess you can pick whatever name you want.  Meantime those of us who&amp;#39;ve largely forsaken programming for writing can just shut up about it and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardkmiller.com/blog/wordpress-plugin-what-would-seth-godin-do&quot;&gt;link to the plugin, already&lt;/a&gt;, by way of saying thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks and a hat tip again to Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>So Many Blogs, So Little Blogger</title>

&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t usually go for confessional blogs myself, so I usually try not to write like mine is one.  You know the genre.  They usually have a tagline that starts with &amp;quot;Just&amp;quot;, to qualify their author&amp;#39;s efforts.  &amp;quot;Just my thoughts on the war&amp;quot;, for example, or &amp;quot;Just the ramblings of a chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes I live up to my own standards so poorly that I would make a great Republican.  So this is just a happy Friday post, depending on the kindness of strangers, living behind the music store.  It is just a confessional post, with the following confessions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love how easy it is to self publish online, because it means there are lots of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate how easy it is to self publish online, because it means that every chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan is in competition with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also hate how easy it is to publish online because I can get confused about which of my projects are important.  Given the terrible, self-imposed imperative to become awesomely popular and the number of chain smoking pregnant teenagers I&amp;#39;m competing with, I feel like I have to come up with a definitive domain / topic / killer app within the next few days or I&amp;#39;ll die penniless, with my young nemeses selling my clothes for cigarette money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know why I hate confessional blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interest of replacing this funk with some creative work, I&amp;#39;m going to shift gears now and work on one of those projects.  If you see any teens catching up with me, for God&amp;#39;s sake, won&amp;#39;t you please let them know how bad smoking is for the baby?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Does SEO Have To Do With Writing?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made my living for many years as a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) specialist with myself and the people who work for me as my sole &amp;quot;client&amp;quot;.  Now with Inklit.com I have an opportunity to explore the broader world of Internet writing.  Like most people, new things interest me only if I can relate them to what I already know.  Because of this, I&amp;#39;m fascinated by how Internet writing in general relates to SEO writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Are Writing and SEO Related?  It Depends Who You Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer you get about the relationship between writing and SEO varies quite a bit depending on who you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro bloggers often tend to minimize SEO.  Authors like Andy Beard and John Chow show a certain disdain for Google-only business models.  Professional bloggers often point out that relying on Google is inherently fragile, since you can&amp;#39;t guarantee that the algorithm that favors you today will continue to bring you good fortune tomorrow.  Furthermore, these authors argue that great writing makes SEO unnecessary, because great writing in itself will lead you to be widely known and recognized, making the search engines superfluous.  In this respect, some authors stress that there&amp;#39;s something we can identify as first class writing, and this first class writing is somehow a thing apart from &amp;quot;mere SEO&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other authors -- often those who are blogging trainers and hosting providers -- stress that SEO is little more than constant writing.  According to the blog salesmen, if you just blog consistently and often and well, you will rise to the top of the search engines.  Do enough writing and you will inevitably rise to the top, so you don&amp;#39;t need an SEO specialist -- what you need is to start blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the pro blogger, SEO has nothing to do with great writing,  and to the blog salesman, SEO is nothing but great writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adequate Writing is Good SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own position is that I can&amp;#39;t envision Search Engine Optimization without writing, especially today.  Many people still cherish the common misconception that meta tags or other secret shortcuts will rocket them to the top somehow, and this misconception doesn&amp;#39;t hurt the professional SEO consultant one bit.  (In fairness I should point out that in the the &amp;quot;title&amp;quot; tag and the &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; meta tag are the exceptions to the misconception).  Were his clients to learn the truth, that good SEO is 90% about writing, I&amp;#39;m sure many SEO fees would go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This riddle captures the essence of the problem, from an SEO consultant&amp;#39;s point of view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q.  What&amp;#39;s the difference between an Internet Writer and a Search Engine Optimization specialist?
A.  About forty dollars per hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, if it&amp;#39;s 90% true that you can write your way to the top, the SEO specialist makes a legitimate stand on the remaining 10%.  Along these lines, there&amp;#39;s one blog salesman who uses one of my blogs as a &amp;quot;case study&amp;quot; of someone who blogged his way to the top of the search engines.  He&amp;#39;s correct that blogging is a big part of my strategy.  Where his analysis fails is that I did several other things that had nothing to do with blogging.  To that extent, I understand and am sympathetic to the SEO specialists emphasis on their &amp;quot;secret sauce&amp;quot;.  (Of course I&amp;#39;m talking about legitimate SEO specialists here, not the &amp;quot;rocket your web site to the top in 24 hours guaranteed&amp;quot; people who show up daily in your mailbox.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Writing is Also Good SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I believe adequate writing will get your web site to 90% of where it needs to be all by itself, I believe that some of the 10% gap we&amp;#39;ve been discussing can also be filled in by writing, especially if your writing is exceptionally good.   One of the things that happens to good writers over time is that they build a human readership.  Depending on your niche, this may be valuable in itself, but from an SEO perspective, it&amp;#39;s always valuable as a source of potential incoming links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Barbara Streisand SEO song goes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;People...
People who need (one way links from high page rank sites that are thematically similar to their own)
Are the luckiest people in the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond incoming links, the other thing that good writing on your blog will buy you are opportunities to go be a good writer on someone else&amp;#39;s blog.  Hey presto:  more incoming links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Adequate Good Enough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that if you&amp;#39;re looking to optimize your site, you should either start writing or hire someone to start writing.  This is the most important thing you can do.  Search engines have gotten much smarter over the years, so that more and more, they&amp;#39;re focused on indexing sites with lots of good, fresh content.  Once once you&amp;#39;re writing on a consistent basis, your next step is to see if you can improve the quality of your material.  Can you learn how to make it more link worthy, and can you find venues off of your main site that can help you to build your link reputation?  Guest blogging and article submission are two great ways to place your writing strategically so you&amp;#39;ll get a search engine boost.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Last Leg of 101 Subscribers in 30 Days</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m into the last 10-day leg of my 101 Subscribers in 30 Days promotion. I&amp;#39;m not as optimistic this time as I was last time, and my numbers have leveled off, at least in the short term. I picked up 34 subscribers in the first ten days, but from that point to today have added only nine more subscribers. As of today we&amp;#39;re at 51 Subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/image-thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still pretty happy overall with the growth of the blog. After all, it&amp;#39;s brand new, and just celebrated its one month birthday on April Fool&amp;#39;s Day. All in all, an average of 202 visitors per day is good at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the biggest contribution to the site&amp;#39;s traffic to date is StumbleUpon, so again, thanks go out to Bob Younce for first submitting me there. Looks like he&amp;#39;s going to win the ad without too much trouble at all &lt;strong&gt;unless some superstar blogger visitor steps up.&lt;/strong&gt; Oh sorry, was that in bold?      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This traffic has slowed to a trickle in recent days, partly because I don&amp;#39;t want to overdo stumbling myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where most of the referrals are coming from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.stumbleupon.com 1,615&lt;br&gt;
http://entrecard.com 157&lt;br&gt;
http://www.google.com 90&lt;br&gt;
http://realestatetomato.typepad.com 79&lt;br&gt;
http://www.mybloglog.com 28&lt;br&gt;
http://www.particlewave.com 26&lt;br&gt;
http://blogsearch.google.com 21&lt;br&gt;
http://activerain.com 21&lt;br&gt;
http://articlespecialist.blogspot.com 16&lt;br&gt;
http://www.problogger.net 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of those Google referrals are from subsbcribers using the reader, the other half are from organic search and blog search. Like StumbleUpon, Entrecard has also slowed to a trickle since I&amp;#39;m not over there mindlessly clicking around. The problogger visits are just from a few comments -- pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m content to let the numbers grow organically from here on, even though I could probably make a concerted effort to land another tasty guest blogging spot and perhaps pull the numbers in by the skin of my teeth. To be honest, at this stage of the game I&amp;#39;m more interested in focusing in on some topics so I&amp;#39;ll know what I&amp;#39;ll do with those next fifty subscribers when I get them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all my current subscribers, thanks so much, and again, I&amp;#39;ll try to keep some worthwhile stuff coming!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Quick and Dirty Grammar Tips</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back I read a story about successful podcasters and one of the podcasts that got a great review was Grammar Girl&amp;#39;s Quick and Dirty Grammar Tips. To tell the truth I&amp;#39;d forgotten all about this site until recently, when I happened to stumble upon it using, as you may have already guessed, StumbleUpon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t subscribe to podcasts, but fortunately Grammar Girl&amp;#39;s (aka Mignon Fogarty&amp;#39;s) work is also available &lt;a href=&quot;http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/default.aspx&quot;&gt;in blog format&lt;/a&gt;. This blog has only been in my reader a short time, but already it&amp;#39;s one of the favorites, because it has good, simple grammar advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent studying the rules of grammar, rhetoric, and style is time well spent. To be sure, most writers hit the mark on these rules a large portion of the time, but I&amp;#39;ve found that my writing improves enormously to the extent I spend a couple of hours per week on the nuts and bolts of the craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to Grammar Girl, I&amp;#39;m not just motivated by self-inflicted self-improvement. On the contrary, Fogarty has a way of making the subject very engaging and an easy read.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Two New Headers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, isn&amp;#39;t this blog supposed to be about writing?  How did these design elements get here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the second one better.  It looks better if you click it to see it full size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife likes the current look and feel better than that one, though.  There&amp;#39;s something about the whole black and white that must be a guy thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/newheader.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/newheader-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;newheader&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Article Submissions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in places where you can submit your articles, check out the guest post I wrote this week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vigorouswriting.net/2008/03/freelance-face-off-ezinearticles-versus.html&quot;&gt;Freelance Faceoff: EZineArticles Versus Associated Content&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you to Jesse Hines at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vigorouswriting.net&quot;&gt;Vigorous Writing&lt;/a&gt; for asking me to send that over and for his kind words about the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing an article for EZineArtices every few days. I mention in the Vigorous Writing article, it&amp;#39;s working out quite well. Here&amp;#39;s my EZineArticles &lt;a href=&quot;http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=John_Lockwood&quot;&gt;Author Page&lt;/a&gt;. Based on one of the mistakes I made, I can offer you the following tip so you can avoid doing the same thing. If you&amp;#39;re going to publish an article somewhere else, be careful if you go back into the EZineArticles editor once your article has been saved and approved. There&amp;#39;s an auto-save feature on the editor. If you&amp;#39;re not careful, you can do what I did, which is accidentally mark an already-approved article as &amp;quot;changed&amp;quot; and thereby send it through the approval process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made that mistake in the context of trying out another article submission site this week: Article City. ArticleCity.com looked really great at first glance, and there were many articles there that had been widely re-circulated. I tried submitting an article there, however, and after a few days it seems pretty likely that nobody&amp;#39;s home. It&amp;#39;s not so unusual that my submission hasn&amp;#39;t received a response yet, but at the same time the site hasn&amp;#39;t changed at all in the past few days. The same article on &amp;quot;Measuring Lubricant Quality&amp;quot; has been on the top of page one during this time, so it doesn&amp;#39;t appear they&amp;#39;ve been approving anyone else&amp;#39;s new articles, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Articles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rumors of the Death of Print</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As an Internet writer, I love hearing about the death of print. All your newspapers and magazines are going to fold any minute, and then everyone will be online all the time looking for rising young pundits like me. Well, &amp;quot;pundits like me&amp;quot;, anyway. The main thing is that we won&amp;#39;t have to deal with those inconvenient literary agents and editors whose poor jobs &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew Keen&lt;/a&gt; is so concerned about. Then we can just hoist up our content and claim our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/26/how-to-retire-on-a-six-figure-adsense-income/&quot;&gt;AdSense Money&lt;/a&gt;. I want my MTV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Favorite Death of Print Picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my favorite picture showing how print is dying, a chart of the stock for McClatchy Company over the last few years. McClatchy is the company that owns several newspapers including my home town paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart shows print dying on schedule. If you read what some of the McClatchy papers have to say about their troubled fortunes, however, they&amp;#39;re more likely to put most of the blame on the declining ad revenue caused by the troubled real estate market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they&amp;#39;re just blowing smoke. Print is dying, I tell you. Didn&amp;#39;t they hear the rumor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Numbers Tell A Different Tale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if print is dying fast enough for my taste, however. Every time I go to Borders, I find three two-sided shelves, fully loaded with print magazines. You&amp;#39;d think they&amp;#39;d be down to two shelves or something if print were really in its death throes, but so far they&amp;#39;re still hanging on quite nicely. There must be at least two dozen magazines dedicated to women&amp;#39;s abdomens alone. Fortunately they only cover the top 1/10th of 1% of women&amp;#39;s abdomens, too, or they could fill up the entire store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if all these magazines weren&amp;#39;t problem enough for the death of print rumor, along comes the web site of the MPA, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magazine.org/home/&quot;&gt;Magazine Publishers of America&lt;/a&gt;. This site publishes all sorts of magazine circulation statistics, for both single issue sales and subscriptions. For example, here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magazine.org/circulation/circulation_trends_and_magazine_handbook/22181.cfm&quot;&gt;2006 subscription figures&lt;/a&gt; for the top 100 ABC magazines. Let&amp;#39;s see how fast print is dying. The two top magazines are AARP magazines at about 22 million subscribers each. Of course, AARP circulation has a captive audience of AARP members, so this number is artificially high. Let&amp;#39;s check out the number three magazine, Reader&amp;#39;s Digest. About 9.7 million people subscribe to that. (I guess it really DOES pay to increase your word power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s see how the blogs are doing. Technorati&amp;#39;s top blog as of today is Engadget, with no subscription numbers available. Fair enough. Tech Crunch, the number two blog, boasts some 734,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the number three ABC magazine has twelve times as many subscribers as the number two blog. Of course, the real readership in each case is harder to measure. How many of those Readers Digests are sitting in a dentist&amp;#39;s office somewhere? We don&amp;#39;t know. Based on my own subscriber and traffic numbers, I would expect TechCrunch&amp;#39;s daily visitor count to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.5 million to 6 million, so Reader&amp;#39;s Digest still wins has a pretty handy lead based on circulation numbers alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll leave the rest of the discussion / spin for the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this &lt;strike&gt;essay&lt;/strike&gt; content, and invite you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;subscribe for more&lt;/a&gt;. I need big subscription numbers for when I release my blog to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;. Hey, wait a minute, wasn&amp;#39;t Amazon.com the company that was selling us all Segue&amp;#39;s a few years back? Whatever happened to those...&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to Retire on a Six Figure AdSense Income</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you were lured to this post by the title, you shouldn&amp;#39;t feel bad.  I didn&amp;#39;t really write this title to trick you, though I did write it to make a point.  I&amp;#39;m actually going to show you how to do it by the end of the article, too, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to accuse me of trickery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to assume you don&amp;#39;t already have a web site, and you&amp;#39;re starting from scratch.  Six figure retirement means our goal is simply to get to $100,000 in AdSense income per year.  This shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard.  Just this morning, I stumbled on this article with the unambitious little title, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediaups.com/2008/03/25/become-the-next-advertising-millionaire/&quot;&gt;Becoming the Next Advertising Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be so easy.  The &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; advertising millionaire.  Wow, there must be thousands of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m Just Like You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that I&amp;#39;m too intelligent to fall for the siren song of Internet riches, but I&amp;#39;m not.  I want to be an Internet advertising rock star just as much as the next guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, lately I&amp;#39;ve been spending a lot of time with AdSense and other ad networks.  This is how I happened to stumble on the &amp;quot;Becoming the Next Advertising Millionaire&amp;quot; article.  I found it during a search for &amp;quot;interstitial ads&amp;quot;.  I visited one of my main blogs today, and found that suddenly there was another web site there, and it was making Firefox crash.  As it turns out, an interstitial ad is an ad where a whole new web site comes up instead of yours, with a link or two that says &amp;quot;Sponsored by &lt;Your Website Name&gt;&amp;quot;.  An ad network I was trying out, AdBrite, leaves these &amp;quot;full page ads&amp;quot; on by default, though you can turn it off.  When I searched for &amp;quot;AdBrite&amp;quot; and the company that was there in place of my site, I learned about &amp;quot;interstitial ads&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know about them, too.  Wow, you&amp;#39;re going to be so filthy rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to Our Six Figure Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I didn&amp;#39;t start on the road to AdSense wealth from scratch.  I have about 3,400 pages of web content under my belt, so I get to play around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One site of mine has 610 pages of blog, and about another 400 pages or so on top of that.  We&amp;#39;re going to use the blog number of 610 pages since that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m running AdSense.  Over the past ten days AdSense reports 2,461 page impressions, and I&amp;#39;m making $2.38 per 1,000 impressions.  My average for all my sites is $2.80 per 1,000 impressions, so we&amp;#39;ll use that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having 2,461 impressions in 10 days means I&amp;#39;m serving up 246.1 impressions per day. There are 610 pages on the blog overall, so that means that each page gets displayed 246.1 / 610 times per day.  Dividing, each page gets displayed .40 times per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to be rich in no time.  Stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get $2.80 per 1,000 page views.  A page of content gets displayed 2.48 times per day.  Our goal is to reach $100,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, $100,000 per year divided by the $2.80 we get per thousand page views means we need to have 35,714 x 1,000 page views per year to make $100,000.  That works out to 35,714,000 page views per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make this work, let&amp;#39;s assume you can write four pages per day, five days per week, on average, and you&amp;#39;re going to start when you&amp;#39;re twenty-one years old.  Fifty-two weeks in a year times twenty posts per week is 1,040 pages per year.  Each page gets viewed .40 times per day, so that means you can generate about 147.25 page views in a year.  Our goal to get to $100,000 in yearly AdSense income is 35,714,000 page views, so let&amp;#39;s see how old we&amp;#39;ll be when we retire.  35,714,000 divided by 147.25 is 245,539, so starting out when you&amp;#39;re twenty-one, you&amp;#39;ll be in a position to earn your six figure AdSense retirement when you&amp;#39;re only 245,518 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were you I&amp;#39;d start typing.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Forthcoming Guest Article on Article Submission Sites</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The past few years have witnessed an explosion in the number of sites promising Freelancers they can make money writing online. Even in small niches, competition abounds. The number of sites competing to match authors of paid reviews with paying sponsors has risen to three (that I know of -- there may be more). Every day another freelance writing job board pokes through the Internet like a dandelion on an already ruined lawn, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobs.copyblogger.com/&quot;&gt;Copyblogger&amp;#39;s new job board&lt;/a&gt; being a famous recent example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;bad_attitude_guy&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, too, can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobs.copyblogger.com/job/7573618562621f33369005ddebb6e2f2/?d=1&quot;&gt;$10 for each 500 word article&lt;/a&gt; you submit. Unless you write a lot faster than me, that works out to about $11.67. per hour for contract work. Did you ever start a blog and then say to yourself, why didn&amp;#39;t I pick something profitable, like a blog about working at McDonalds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/bad_attitude_guy&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the interest in transforming online writing from a hobby into a profit center, it&amp;#39;s not surprising that article submission boards have risen in popularity. Bob Younce &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/a-directory-of-internet-article-writing-sites&quot;&gt;recently surveyed&lt;/a&gt; five such sites and still had nine left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been asked to do a guest article comparing two such sites, Associated Content and EZineArticles. It should be out in a day or two. I will let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be time for bad&lt;em&gt;attitude&lt;/em&gt;guy to go find a mentor or two.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tips for Setting Writing Goals — A Stack of Twenty</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;How are we to write well, and consistently? There are days when writing is simplicity itself, when ideas and connections seem to grow in natural abundance, when we feel the only limitation of human eloquence is our typing speed. Then there are days when we must write through the dense stickiness of our own stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is writing&amp;#39;s horror and its beauty: only your mind sits between your contribution to the world and the void from which it springs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we trick our minds into performing better? I believe we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blundered into this Monday knowing I wasn&amp;#39;t wearing my big brain. It&amp;#39;s the week I finally finish up my taxes and get them to my accountant. It&amp;#39;s the week I pay my insurance bill. It&amp;#39;s a week so full of dullness that wearing my small brain is a form of prosaic justice. It&amp;#39;s a week that would put my big brain to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small brain or not, though, I still have to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this week I&amp;#39;m trying on a new trick to keep my small brain from hurting itself while running with sharpened pencils. The trick is the stack of twenty. Here&amp;#39;s the trick if you want to try it out yourself. Take out twenty file cards, and plan your week into twenty tasks. In my case this worked out to be nineteen cards with either a blog post or online article per card, plus a card for the remaining tax work. Planning out the week took about fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that as you complete a task or article, you put a big checkbox on the card and move it to the done stack. If something unforeseen comes up and you handle it, write a quick card for it with a big check mark and put it in the done pile. If you have any cards left over, you can always recycle them into next week, and if you get through the whole stack, your small brain will delight in its accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a way to make your small brain feel good about itself. You need this if you&amp;#39;re having a small brain week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your big brain doesn&amp;#39;t need such a simple trick as this, but if you&amp;#39;re anything like me, you can&amp;#39;t always wear your big brain to work.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What I Learned About AdSense from Associated Content</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;AdSense and I have a checkered past.  I had an account several years ago, but never made much from it.  Last week I decided that really ought to take another look at ad networks like AdSense, since I believe that Pro Blogger / Online Publisher is a legitimate career path for an Internet writer (albeit one with a long start-up curve and a crowded field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last week I put up some AdSense on a popular real estate blog I own, and again the results were not all that spectacular -- a couple of bucks per day.  But things got interesting soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask any kid with a chemistry set.  Nothing interesting happens until you mix two things together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Associated Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;#39;t think that Associated Content would have much to do with AdSense on the face of it.  AdSense lets you generate ad revenue from your web site, and Associated Content is a place where you can sell writing online if you don&amp;#39;t mind not getting paid much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tipped me off to the idea that those to things are actually not all that different was a single unifying statistic, CPM.  That&amp;#39;s an ad term that you probably know, which means &amp;quot;Cost per Thousand (Impressions)&amp;quot;.  Of course as a publisher I&amp;#39;m not interested in cost so much as revenue.  Some people call this RPM (Revenue Per Thousand).  Google uses the weird expression eCPM, or &amp;quot;Effective Cost Per Thousand&amp;quot;, but effective or not, we&amp;#39;re talking about revenue here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I signed up for Associated Content, I knew the rates would probably be lower than they would be for direct writing sales.  I tried them out because I thought it would be an easy way to make a quick writing sale or two, and I wanted to see what they offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a report on the rates yet, because the first article I tried was submitted for up front payment review, which can take up to two weeks.  I can tell you that others have reported numbers that don&amp;#39;t impress me much, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://freelancefromhome.blogspot.com/2006/12/make-money-writing-articles-online.html&quot;&gt;$7.00 per article&lt;/a&gt;.  Based on that, I doubt I&amp;#39;ll be writing up a storm for them, but we&amp;#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really got me interested, however, was when I saw their performance payments, which is based on what they call (wait for it...) &lt;strong&gt;PPM&lt;/strong&gt;, or &amp;quot;Payment Per Thousand&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PPM, CPM, RPM, eCPM -- How Much Money Are We Talking Here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What got my attention immediately about Associated Content&amp;#39;s PPM was that it was $1.50.  My AdSense account hovers around $9.00 per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking.  If AdSense pays about $9.00 per thousand page views, six times as much as Associated Content, maybe Associated Content would turn out to be the victor over AdSense in the Worst-Way-To-Make-Money-Online Throw Down.  Are you ready to rumble?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also got me wondering about how many page views my web sites had, and what that would look like divided by 1,000 and then multiplied by $9.00!  It turns out that I may be able to make several hundred per month off of Adsense for a month&amp;#39;s work or so, since I have a fair sized inventory of unperforming content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Inventory of unperforming content&amp;quot;.  See, I&amp;#39;m talking like a publisher already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Kind of CPM do Real Estate Brokers Make?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I started thinking in terms of CPM, I got curious about how much money I made last year as a real estate broker from my real estate web sites.  So I did some really rough-draft calculations, and came up with a figure of somewhere between $20 to $30 per 1,000.  That&amp;#39;s not bad considering where we are in the &amp;quot;real estate meltdown&amp;quot; (also known as &amp;quot;the credit crunch&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the end of carbon based life as we know it&amp;quot;, depending on who you ask).  I could probably do $60 per 1,000 if I wanted to hop in the car more and do more sales, but of course that would be cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Publishing Epiphany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time yesterday I had a publishing epiphany, where everything I&amp;#39;d ever written online turned into a viewable page, a 1/1000th fraction of an M that could produce some revenue value for me, some &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about thinking about RPM is that it teaches us that we as publishers can increase either our RPM (look for better publishing or ad opportunities) or our M (write more, or promote it better), and either way we&amp;#39;ll get more R, more Revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in a future post we&amp;#39;ll talk about the results of my attempting to increase RPM and continue to increase it over time using an open source Ad Server, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openx.org&quot;&gt;OpenX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>&quot;101 Subscribers in 30 Days to a New Blog&quot; - Campaign Progress Report</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/101-subscribers-progress-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/101-subscribers-progress-1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;101_subscribers_progress_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten days ago I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;How To Get 101 Subscribers to your New Blog in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt;. This means I&amp;#39;m one third of the way to our April 10th deadline to claim the 101 subscriber bragging rights. So here&amp;#39;s an account of our progress so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I posted the article on the eleventh, I had a grand total of eight subscribers, down from a high of ten a couple of days earlier. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve reached a high of forty-four subscribers as of a couple of days ago, and currently we&amp;#39;re showing forty-two subscribers. So we&amp;#39;ve added 34 subscribers in ten days. Assuming we can do that again twice in the twenty days that remain, we&amp;#39;ll finish up with 110 subscribers, well above the 101 we&amp;#39;re shooting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve Learned, Guest Posts, and The Winner So Far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting thirty-four subscribers again during each of the next two ten-day periods will be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that of the 34 subscribers we&amp;#39;ve picked up so far, probably about twenty of them come from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html&quot;&gt;guest post&lt;/a&gt; on the Real Estate Tomato. Another two to four probably come from miscellaneous sources including ActiveRain, and the remaining ten to twelve come from StumbleUpon. So the likely winner to date for the contest would be Jim Cronin at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Real Estate Tomato&lt;/a&gt;, with the runner up spot going to Bob Younce at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing-journey.com/&quot;&gt;Writing Journey&lt;/a&gt; for introducing my site to StumbleUpon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a subscriber standpoint, the guest post had the best results, StumbleUpon has done a better job in terms of raw traffic. StumbleUpon has sent me 614 hits to date, versus 120 for Entrecard and sixty-five for the Real Estate Tomato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest Post Progress Stalls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost forward momentum on the guest posts after the Tomato article. I submitted an article to Anne Wayman at the Golden Pencil, but got no response after almost a week and another email. Since then I&amp;#39;ve sent a rewrite of that article to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisblogging.com&quot;&gt;ChrisBlogging.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll let you know if it goes anywhere the second time, and how the other submissions go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial time: Do you have great traffic and want a guest post to win a six month ad? Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise/&quot;&gt;ad contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been making more progress on submitting some articles to low-paying or link-paying article submission sites. The ones I&amp;#39;ve tried so far are Associated Content (which doesn&amp;#39;t impress me, even though they pay) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ezinearticles.com&quot;&gt;EZineArticles.com&lt;/a&gt; (which does impress me, even though they don&amp;#39;t pay). I do expect to get some benefit from EZineArticles over time given the links they let you publish, but I don&amp;#39;t expect to see results before the April 10th deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have my work cut out for me to get to 101 in 30 days, but I&amp;#39;m on track so far, and I&amp;#39;m very pleased with how things are going. My unique visitor count is certainly better than I expected it to be at this point (more than 200 per day on average, which I consider excellent for 21 days on a brand new domain). I&amp;#39;ve made some new friends, and it seems like every day I&amp;#39;m learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Should Internet Writers Do Paid Reviews?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/21/eight-questions-you-should-ask-before-you-buy-a-paid-review&quot;&gt;Eight Questions Advertisers Should Ask before Buying a Paid Review&lt;/a&gt;, we looked at paid reviews from a consumer&amp;#39;s point of view, with a view to educating advertisers about how to find out if paid reviews should be part of their ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we&amp;#39;ll look at the other side of the equation.  Should paid reviews be part of a professional writer&amp;#39;s repertoire, and if so, what should we understand about paid reviews before putting up our Paypal links and beginning to hawk our endorsements?  As before, let&amp;#39;s look at the questions one should be asking before getting started with paid reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six Questions Writers Should Ask Before Offering Paid Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Does Your Blog Rely on Google?
*&lt;/em&gt;If your blog relies on Google, you may want to seriously consider whether paid reviews are right for you.  At the very least you&amp;#39;ll want to review our article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/18/paid-reviews-googles-problem-with-them-and-how-to-solve-it&quot;&gt;paid reviews and Google&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure your buyer understands that they&amp;#39;re buying a human endorsement and human click-throughs, not a page rank boost.  Even then, I would think twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue came up for me recently.  Among the many web sites I have, one web site and blog has done more to support me than any other for the last five years.  The key to its success has been outstanding search engine placement for a group of profitable keywords.  Recently a gentleman contacted me from that blog to do a paid review for a client&amp;#39;s web site about Payday Loans.  To me the &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; answer was immediately obvious.  There was no way I was going to jeopardize a high-five-figure revenue stream for a $20 or $50 or even $500 review about a subject like that.  Not on that blog.  Hey, there&amp;#39;s an idea...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Can You Own (or &amp;quot;Rent&amp;quot;) A Blog Where Paid Reviews Are Appropriate?
*&lt;/em&gt;One solution to the conundrum above, of course, would have been to sell the prospect a review on another blog.  This could be either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A third party blog.&lt;/strong&gt; Your client may have approached you with the idea of buying a paid review, but does the review have to go on your blog?  Can you take a paid review opportunity and convert it into a paid article placement opportunity?  Article placement is great way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/14/five-ways-to-upsell-your-online-writing/&quot;&gt;upsell your writing&lt;/a&gt; by offering not just the writing itself, but a brokered placement on an appropriate site.   Some marketing specialists offer article placement as a core component of their services, and there&amp;#39;s no reason why writers should not exploit this opportunity as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A blog you create for reviews and other content&lt;/strong&gt;.  One of the opportunities I envision for my writing business is to create and promote at least one &amp;quot;general review&amp;quot; blog along the general lines of TechCrunch.  Part of this blog&amp;#39;s mission in life would be to host paid reviews, since it&amp;#39;s a place where miscellaneous reviews would be entirely relevant.  And that brings me to my next point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s Your Blog About, Anyway?
*&lt;/em&gt;Even if you can solve &amp;quot;the Google problem&amp;quot; with paid articles by dutifully applying a nofollow tag to your links back to your client, does having a link to &amp;quot;Great New Web Site About Canadian Pharmaceuticals&amp;quot; dilute the brand message that you&amp;#39;d otherwise be establishing for your readers ?  Also, assuming you&amp;#39;re trying to optimize for &amp;quot;Freelance Writer&amp;quot; or the like, what&amp;#39;s the SEO effect of having your content start to be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot; (at the page level) Canadian pharmaceuticals or pay day loans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Does It Pay?&lt;/strong&gt;
If this list were in order of importance, the issue of payment would have been item #1.  We&amp;#39;re running a business here, after all.  If the pay day loan fellow above threw a million dollars at me, my next question would have been &amp;quot;How fast can I run to my keyboard?&amp;quot;  Bob Younce rightly brought up this point earlier in the article series.I admit that I have a lot more to learn in this area.  I have not yet reviewed the &amp;quot;big three&amp;quot; paid review services (links to them are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/17/paid-reviews-freelance-writer-boon-or-bargain-with-the-devil&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but I suspect I&amp;#39;ll find that if there are places where the money is good, the trade off will be that the reviews may be somewhat compromising to the web properties I already own.  Also, as with most jobs (in writing and everywhere else), the extent to which a job pays well is inversely proportional to the number of people involved in finding you the job.  The flip side of that coin is always the time it would take to find the work on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;If I&amp;#39;m Brand New, Will the Writing Credits Help Me?
*&lt;/em&gt;If you&amp;#39;re new in your writing career, paid reviews may help to give you some credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s My Writing &amp;quot;Career Track&amp;quot;?
*&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;Professional writing&amp;quot; is not a monolithic thing, and neither is &amp;quot;Internet writing&amp;quot;.  An oversimplified way to look at Internet writing is that there are &amp;quot;pro bloggers&amp;quot; on the one hand versus &amp;quot;freelancers&amp;quot; on the other.  The pro blogger group is a huge, diverse population consisting of twenty or thirty rock stars and about fifty million teenagers with electric guitars.  Paid reviews are almost always appropriate for this group, though interestingly enough one of the rock stars, TechCrunch, doesn&amp;#39;t do them.   The latter group, the freelancers, is considerably smaller and generally quite capable of hunting larger game than the paid review.  But remember:  even wolves don&amp;#39;t turn up their noses at a tasty mouse if it happens to walk right by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Eight Questions You Should Ask Before You Buy a Paid Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing our article series on paid reviews, in this segment we want to zero in on paid reviews from the advertiser&amp;#39;s point of view.  Are paid reviews something you should be spending your limited ad budget on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that a paid review can help you achieve your online goals, but the chances are you heard that from someone selling paid reviews.  That&amp;#39;s not to say these people are dishonest or that their reviews might not help, but at the very least you should know what questions to ask yourself before you spend your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here then are eight questions to ask yourself before you buy that paid review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you expect to gain by buying a review?&lt;/strong&gt;
The more you&amp;#39;re looking to spend, the more time you should spend thinking about this.  Are you buying sheer traffic and hoping to convert visitors to an immediate sale?  Are you hoping to convert visitors to a subscription to your blog now and develop a client over time?  Are you looking for links to give you a page rank boost and improve your position on the search engines?  Are you hoping that a celebrity endorsement will help buyers accept your product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Are you looking for incoming link love (a page rank boost)?
*&lt;/em&gt;If buying a review is a way of buying links, do you know for certain that you won&amp;#39;t run afoul of Google&amp;#39;s algorithm?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/18/paid-reviews-googles-problem-with-them-and-how-to-solve-it/&quot;&gt;We know&lt;/a&gt; that Google frowns on pages that contain paid reviews, and so, especially if you&amp;#39;re buying multiple reviews where Google can analyze the pattern of links pointing to you, do you know for certain that you won&amp;#39;t run afoul of the very algorithm you&amp;#39;re trying to game?  Are you buying multiple reviews?  Will your review appear on a site that sells multiple reviews?  Either way, in my opinion there&amp;#39;s a decent chance that you won&amp;#39;t get the result you&amp;#39;re trying to gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What If you did this 100 times?
*&lt;/em&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you have $2,000 to spend, and you can buy reviews for $20.00.  That&amp;#39;s 100 reviews -- not bad.  However, will Google devalue a site that has 100 paid reviews pointing to it, and is that important to you?    Now take the same $2,000, and let&amp;#39;s say you can buy about sixty blog pages on your corporate blog.  Now you have sixty pages of blog pages optimized for long tail keywords related to your product.  We know for a fact that Google doesn&amp;#39;t penalize unique content -- it indexes it.  Of course, if you&amp;#39;ve decided that search results aren&amp;#39;t a huge part of your business model, or if you&amp;#39;re only running a single review, you may not care about the issue of whether what you&amp;#39;re doing is sustainable over time.  I think the best approach for most clients is the one that I myself practice here:  when in doubt, produce unique content on your own web site.  70-90% of your activity and spending should be in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Does it make sense for the reviewer to use my product?
*&lt;/em&gt;Making sure the reviewer is a potential user of your product increases the relevance of your review as well as its credibility.  The reviewer may not be using your product yet, but does it at least make sense that he might?  If someone&amp;#39;s blogging about brewing beer and I&amp;#39;m selling cool stainless steel beer taps, that&amp;#39;s a natural fit, and a review here might do me quite a lot of good, especially if the blogger is well known and likes my product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Does it make sense for the reviewer&amp;#39;s readers to use my products?
*&lt;/em&gt;Even more important than the issue of whether the author might use my product is the issue of whether his readers might.  To take the beer brewing case above, if the blogger&amp;#39;s target audience is home brewers and you&amp;#39;re selling 15,000 gallon commercial beer vats, then clearly you have a bit of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Will the reviewer disclose that the review is paid?
*&lt;/em&gt;Given the bad press that undisclosed reviews have received and Google&amp;#39;s suggestion that paid reviews be disclosed, I&amp;#39;d recommend that the answer should be yes.  If the blogger is not disclosing that the review is paid, you should think about whether your reputation would be harmed if people learn that it was.  If the answer is yes, make sure you ask for full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;How popular is the reviewer, relative to what he&amp;#39;s charging?
*&lt;/em&gt;All else being equal, I would go for the reviewer with the better cost per subscriber.  Let&amp;#39;s take two bloggers I know.  Both run good blogs that are very interesting to read.  One blogger has approximately 21,000 readers and charges $500 per review.  The other blogger has approximately 180 readers, and charges $25 for a review.  Naturally you need a bigger budget for the first blogger, but your cost per subscriber reached is 2.38 cents versus 13.8 cents for the second blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;What else could you be doing with the budget?
*&lt;/em&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already talked about what would happen if you paid for a review 100 times over, and discussed some other marketing spends you could make such as blogging about your product.  In my opinion it&amp;#39;s very hard to beat the benefit of keyword rich content that is keyed to your product or service.  However, if you&amp;#39;re spending a smaller amount and just want to generate some immediate traffic, you might consider alternatives such as Google Adwords or Yahoo Pay-per-click advertising.  The beauty of pay-per-click is that you have complete control over the keywords you bid on, and that the person searching for your product is searching for the very solution you provide.  Someone who wants web analytics software may read Darren Rowse.  He&amp;#39;s popular among webmasters, and webmasters often need web analytics software.  Chances are, however, that you&amp;#39;d find a much higher proportion of buyers for &amp;quot;web analytics software&amp;quot; among people searching for that term specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself these eight questions, and you&amp;#39;ll be in a better position to spend your money wisely and get the best results for your advertising dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internet Writer, Bob Younce</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a writer working on the Internet, Bob Younce&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing-journey.com&quot;&gt;Writing Journey&lt;/a&gt; is one of the blogs you should be reading.  I&amp;#39;m not saying this because Bob&amp;#39;s blog is an easy read, though don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, his style is fine.  Bob&amp;#39;s blog can be a tough read because it&amp;#39;s loaded with the kind of advice that makes you think &amp;quot;You know, darn it, he&amp;#39;s right -- that is something I should be doing a better job at doing.&amp;quot;  For example, his article &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/4-keys-to-establishing-your-brand-as-an-internet-writer&quot;&gt;4 Keys to Establishing Your Brand as an Internet Writer&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of the fact that this blog, Inklit, had yet to settle on what it wants to be when it grows up.  Am I writing for would-be Internet writers, sharing my journey from a one-client-wonder to a writer who&amp;#39;s succeeding online?  Or am I changing the title tag to Internet Writer and going for the gusto as a search engine optimized sales piece?  Or am I just another ProBlogger wannabe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jamoke&quot;&gt;jamoke&lt;/a&gt; with an AdSense account, a pink carnation and a pickup truck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another really great thing about Bob&amp;#39;s blog is that unlike many blogs, it comes with Bob!    What distinguishes Bob from most of the writers out there is that he doesn&amp;#39;t just write for the Internet -- he actually reads it as well.   Bob was one of the first people to come by, find my blog, and engage me in a conversation, and he makes a good case for establishing such peer relationships in his 4 Keys article.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Paid Reviews: Google’s Problem With Them and How To Solve It</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is Part II in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/17/paid-reviews-freelance-writer-boon-or-bargain-with-the-devil&quot;&gt;article series&lt;/a&gt; on Paid Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you write paid reviews on your site?   Most bloggers would be honored to be asked, even if they&amp;#39;re not freelance writers and therefore already thinking along the lines of getting paid to write.   For freelancers it&amp;#39;s a natural, that&amp;#39;s true by definition.  You pay me, I write something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers make a few extra dollars writing paid reviews, and top bloggers make a lot of money at it.  Do you want your site reviewed at JohnChow.com?  That&amp;#39;ll be $500, please.  That&amp;#39;s not a bad rate for an hour or two of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paid reviews do have some problems, however, and you should know about these before you start offering them on your blog.  In this Article, I&amp;#39;ll discuss the main technical objection to paid reviews -- that Google might penalize your web site for having them -- and show you how to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&amp;#39;s Position on Paid Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss Google&amp;#39;s position on paid reviews, we need to understand why people would pay you to review their site.  What is the customer for a paid review hoping to gain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two basic reasons someone might pay you to write a review about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;The Customer Wants a Direct, Human Boost in Their Reputation and Traffic
*&lt;/em&gt;We all know about celebrity endorsements.  Where would the Craftmatic bed be without Lindsey Wagner, or the GAF Viewmaster without Henry Fonda?  Celebrity endorsements are just a form of personal referral, where someone&amp;#39;s paying someone they hope you&amp;#39;ve heard of to endorse their product.  Paid reviews are a small scale application of the same basic thing.  You pay someone to talk about you and link to you, hoping their readers will find you and then buy something, or at least that they will start reading you, enjoy it, and tell someone they know to buy something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;The Customer Wants an Indirect, Computer-Friendly Boost in Their Reputation and Traffic
*&lt;/em&gt;Another reason a customer would want a paid review on your site is that search engine algorithms like Google&amp;#39;s also consider a link to your site to be an endorsement of its content.  If Brian Clark of CopyBlogger.com links to Inklit.com like this:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Online Copywriter&lt;/a&gt;, then according to the Google&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank&quot;&gt;page rank algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, Inklit.com is more likely to be about an Online Copywriter than if he didn&amp;#39;t.  In other words, the link gives my site a reputation boost on Google that&amp;#39;s every bit as important as the human reputation boost I would receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, back to Google.  As with so many &amp;quot;what is Google thinking?&amp;quot; sort of questions, the best answer to Google&amp;#39;s position on paid links comes in an article that Matt Cutts wrote.  In this case the article in question is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/selling-links-that-pass-pagerank/&quot;&gt;Selling Links That Pass Page Rank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, Google doesn&amp;#39;t care at all about item 1, but it does care about item 2.  Google considers buying paid reviews to be a form of link buying, and devalues pages or sites that engage in it for attempting to artificially manipulate page rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Safe Endorsement:  Wear a Link Condom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the invention of blogs, many people started commenting on other people&amp;#39;s blogs to get links back to their own site.  To combat this, Google invented the &amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot; tag.  The idea was that you could add a bit of code to the link to mark it as being one that the webmaster himself did not endorse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t long before Google decided that not only should &amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot; apply to links that other people write on my site -- it should also apply to links that I myself write, if I&amp;#39;m being paid to write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So getting back to our earlier example, if I buy a review from Brian Clark and he wants to let Google know that he&amp;#39;s not cross-his-heart, pinkie-swear endorsing me, he&amp;#39;s just endorsing me because I&amp;#39;m sending him money to be insincere, he should choose the &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; version of the following link:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/linkcondom.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/linkcondom-thumb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;linkcondom&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to write a paid review and you don&amp;#39;t want the review to adversely affect your Google rankings, you should add a nofollow tag as shown above to your links.  Many good blogging tools such as Live Writer have a way to do this without having to get into the HTML view and tweak the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Cutts has also hinted that you should disclose in the article that the review is paid, though to my knowledge there&amp;#39;s no standard, machine readable way to say your review is paid, so it&amp;#39;s hard to see whether this is just Matt&amp;#39;s preference or something in the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Paid Reviews: Freelance Writer Boon or Bargain With The Devil?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a freelance writer who&amp;#39;s looking to do paid reviews?   Should you do them or should you avoid them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paid reviews have become very popular (or perhaps infamous), as bloggers offer them on their own blogs and as services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://payperpost.com/&quot;&gt;PayPerPost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogsvertise.com&quot;&gt;Blogvertise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reviewme.com&quot;&gt;ReviewMe&lt;/a&gt; start trying to capitalize by connecting advertisers and writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet paid reviews are not without their problems.  Should the fact that a review is paid be disclosed, in much the same way that you see &amp;quot;PAID ADVERTISEMENT&amp;quot; disclaimers in printed magazine articles?   Can doing a paid review get you in trouble with the search engines, and if so, how can you minimize the problem?  Are paid reviews viable to do for advertisers?  Are they profitable for bloggers?  If they&amp;#39;re not profitable, can we make them more profitable?  If you do write paid reviews, do you have to agree with your client&amp;#39;s position?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days I will be writing several articles about paid reviews to examine these issues and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get all the articles in the Paid Reviews series, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog&quot;&gt;subscribe now using RSS&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/12/what-is-rss-and-how-do-i-use-it/&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=1751901&amp;amp;loc=en_US&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers, What Do You Think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you offer paid reviews?  Have they been a good source of revenue to you?  Are you opposed for ideological reasons?  Opposed for practical reasons?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My Writing Partner, Purva Brown</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me from my real estate brokerage may also know Purva Brown, who contributes to my real estate blog.  Purva also hosts a fine real estate blog of her own, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com&quot;&gt;The Sacramento Real Estate Gal&lt;/a&gt;.  Purva joined my real estate company last year.  She originally thought she was taking on a mentor when it comes to search engine optimization and Internet marketing, but as it turned out, Purva&amp;#39;s helped me to expand my writing horizons at least as much as I ever helped her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purva and I are currently hammering out an agreement to collaborate on several projects.  Our first is putting up an online store to help us market and sell e-books and PLR content.  If all goes well we should be launching our first product together, Purva&amp;#39;s ebook for real estate investors, before the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a real estate investor herself, Purva and her husband, James, went through their share of landlord horror stories.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landlordlandmines.com&quot;&gt;Landlord Land Mines&lt;/a&gt; is the book Purva wished they&amp;#39;d had when had when they were getting started.  Landlord Land Mines is written both from her own experience and from the experience of many other landlords who she interviewed for the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the theory and the spreadsheets -- Landlord Land Mines puts together decades of collective experience and stories from real investors, who teach you what you need to know and what you need to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Landlord Land Mines when it becomes available.  Avoid the land mines -- because blowing your leg off can ruin your whole day!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Entrecard - Ad Network Plus Social Network</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://entrecard.com/&quot;&gt;Entrecard&lt;/a&gt; today and signed up. Entrecard is an intriguing mix of a social network plus an advertising network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrecard is a free service that combines the idea of a traditional business card with the 125 x 125 pixel ad format that is so popular on blogs today. When you sign up, you&amp;#39;re asked to upload an image that size to create your ad / online business card. (You can enter text if you don&amp;#39;t have an image file). That image becomes your online ad / business card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Once you&amp;#39;ve set up your account, you get some widget code that you add to your blog, and then you&amp;#39;re ready to visit other Entrecard members and &amp;quot;drop&amp;quot; your card off at their site using their widget, in the same way you might hand a business card to someone you meet in person. Dropping your card off and having others drop their card off at your blog in turn earns you Entrecard credits, which you can the use to buy &amp;quot;ads&amp;quot;, that is, have your card featured on another user&amp;#39;s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll also be able to sell these credits if you&amp;#39;re not using them for cash, or to buy more credits with which to purchase ads on other user&amp;#39;s sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money Maker or Promotional Tool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the authors of the site point out on their pricing page, this service &amp;quot;will not make you rich, no matter how good a guess you make at your pricing.&amp;quot; From an advertiser&amp;#39;s perspective, freelance writers who aren&amp;#39;t on the professional blogger track would probably be better off buying a precisely targeted AdSense ad or working on blog content related to their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I think Entrecard is a worthwhile blog promotional tool. If your web site has space for ads, until those spots are sold profitably or pointing to your own products and services, an Entrecard widget is a good use for one spot. It may help you identify some congenial colleagues on the one hand, and help you build your own blog&amp;#39;s community on the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some of the first blogs I went to were of mixed quality, after a short time I found a few good ones. For example, I&amp;#39;ll review an excellent blog about improving your writing in a future post. Several other blogs were quite entertaining but less relevant here, but the gems I did find made it worth the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concern I have about the Entrecard is that -- like most social networks -- the pleasure of participating hides the fact that it&amp;#39;s very labor intensive. In contrast, my experience with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;101 Subscribers&lt;/a&gt; campaign to date has taught me not to turn up my nose at a well placed guest blogging opportunity. I&amp;#39;ve almost quadrupled my visitor count in two days, largely through this &lt;a href=&quot;http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html&quot;&gt;guest blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Social networks I&amp;#39;ve announced the contest to have been less helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, as with any blog promotional campaign or tool, Entrecard can get you started, but without good, consistent writing and a clear purpose it won&amp;#39;t help you much. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Five Ways To Upsell Your Online Writing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Bob Bly recently asked his readers to talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bly.com/blog/?p=317&quot;&gt;Number One Perk of Freelance Writing&lt;/a&gt;. To me a major perk of freelancing is the ability to sell your writing in so many different ways. What especially excites me is the ability to bring products to market online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling written products online is a challenge. Millions of blogs compete for a reader&amp;#39;s attention, and for a reader, the price is usually perfect -- they&amp;#39;re free! A pessimistic view of selling information online is that it competes with such proverbial sales challenges as selling snow to Eskimos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the optimist sees the same scene and notes that the Internet is full of very literate people who are thirsty for information. (Eskimos must like snow -- look at where they live!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blind optimism aside, it helps enormously if we can add value to the books or article we&amp;#39;re selling online, and many noteworthy authors such as Angela Booth and Brian Clark use this technique to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here, then, are five ways to add value and upsell your writing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Teaching Sells.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Brian Clark&amp;#39;s TeachingSells.com is based on the premise that people will pay a premium to improve their skills. This is as true today as it was when learning to speak a foreign language or play piano were some the basis for some of the most successful direct mail marketing campaigns in history.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Ebook plus Consulting&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;A variation on the Teaching Sells theme is one that Angela Booth frequently uses, combining an ebook with training and consulting.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;The Private Forum&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;One way that many authors including Brian Clark and Courtney Ramirez have offered teaching and consulting and upsold their information is by offering access to a private forum, allowing users who are learning access to one another and to the trusted expert who&amp;#39;s doing the teaching.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Free Updates&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Is your 39-page ebook only worth 4.95? $9.95? How much is it worth if you offer free updates for a period of time? Your web store should support allowing downloads for a specified period of time (The one I&amp;#39;m presently working on does). This is a variation on the &amp;quot;Free Upgrades&amp;quot; upsell that has served software vendors well for years.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Private Label Rights&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Some products are a natural for this approach. The best customer for your ebook may not be the reader, but someone who is trying to sell something to the reader. The ebook can be customized with links to your client&amp;#39;s web site and used as a free download. Another approach is to sell both the ebook and the sales copy for the contact form to download the free ebook (meantime allowing your client to capture the reader&amp;#39;s contact information). Can you create an ebook that others will want to use in their own sales efforts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just five ways to add value to your ebooks and articles. I&amp;#39;m sure there are many others. Readers, do you have techniques you&amp;#39;ve used or admired?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Write This Word: Monetize</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Early twenty-first century English speakers have an ear for ugly words. For example, having created the most significant advance in democratizing publishing since moveable type, we made up the ugliest word we could for it: &amp;quot;the blog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The blog&amp;quot;. I saw that movie when I was a kid. Steve McQueen was in it. I worried about the blog getting the poor little dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not content to write our online journals using an ugly word, at some point many of us have the capitalist afterthought that we want to make money with our &amp;quot;blogs&amp;quot;. Dutiful speakers of early 21st century English that we are, we&amp;#39;ll need an ugly word for that, too. So we say we need to &lt;strong&gt;_monetize _&lt;/strong&gt;our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To it&amp;#39;s credit, at least &amp;quot;monetize&amp;quot; captures the general idea that we we&amp;#39;re just sitting here typing, minding our own not-yet-a-business, when suddenly we needed to grab some AdSense code and paste it in here somewhere, so we could be monetized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show me the monety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Excuse for Using the &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The machines are watching what we write.&amp;quot; Forty years ago that sentence would have been a paranoid fantasy. Today it&amp;#39;s just a description of the search engines. Because the machines are watching what we write, I have to use the word &amp;quot;monetize&amp;quot;, because I&amp;#39;m hoping that someone looking to monetize their blog will come by and read me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say monetize, therefore I am monetized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have to like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;When Should You Monetize Your Blog?&amp;quot; and Other Pseudo-Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Orwell was famous (partly) for telling us that sloppy language could lead us to think sloppily. We hear about monetizing our blogs, and wonder at what point we should start monetizing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think you should make money off your blogging efforts. You should have a living made partly or largely from professional writing online, just like I do. That&amp;#39;s what this blog is about, to explore different ways of doing that. The problem with &amp;quot;monetizing&amp;quot; as a word and a concept is that it implies that you started out doing something that wasn&amp;#39;t worth money, and Adsense or some other magic wand is going to transform your lonely prose into something people will throw money at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you to think this way instead. The following may sound like a group of New Age affirmations that only Stuart Smalley could love, but try them on for a moment and tell me if they help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have something to write that&amp;#39;s worth reading, or if I don&amp;#39;t, I can improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can sell something worth buying, and get paid for it. If I don&amp;#39;t know how to sell or what to sell, I can learn how to sell or find something to sell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog I&amp;#39;m dreaming about / starting up / working on now is a vehicle for making that happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will keep at it until I am successful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I saying you shouldn&amp;#39;t use AdSense? Not at all -- if that&amp;#39;s a good way for you to sell, then go for it! Advertising is certainly something you can sell and some people make big money at it. I think most people will make more money, however, if they consider a mix of &amp;quot;ads&amp;quot; for their own products and services, or private ad transactions and affiliate programs. John Chow got rid of AdSense and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnchow.com/blog-income-report-february-2008/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; $14,450 in private ad sales revenue for February. To give AdSense its due, Darren Rowse, who&amp;#39;s no slouch either, recently reported that AdSense is his overall winner. Up until recently, my own business model had about three notes in it: Blog. Sell house. Blog. Hire agents to sell house. Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve added these notes: Write. Learn. Write. Sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to fail is to stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future post, I&amp;#39;ll talk about how some of these ideas have played out on this blog and in my own life and work so far, and some of the stupid fears that have limited me. If others have similar examples from their own lives and work and want to share I&amp;#39;d love to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Link Karma, and Can You Get 101 Subscribers to a New Blog in 30 Days?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, you can sure give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having great fun working on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;101 Subscribers in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt; promotion on my new Inklit Writing Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have stopped by and have helped me out tremendously as I work on the program. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valleymarket.com/&quot;&gt;Wasilla Realtor®, Marty Van Diest&lt;/a&gt; came by and lit a fire under me that I know needed lighting, to allow email subscribers as well as RSS subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter not so much related to getting 101 new subscribers in 30 days as it is to overall gratitude, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4realz.net&quot;&gt;Authentic Real Estate Engagement&lt;/a&gt; expert, Dustin Luther, stopped by a couple of weeks ago to help me out on another issue that I needed some help with. I appreciated his visit and the support. You should check out Dustin&amp;#39;s blog if you&amp;#39;re a real estate agent / broker interested in taking full advantage of Web 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Win a Six Month Ad on a New Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize you&amp;#39;d rather have a six month ad on Problogger, but I didn&amp;#39;t write that one! Those of you who like contests and who don&amp;#39;t mind taking a bit of a risk (your time only, not your gold) on a brand new venture may want to try pitching in to see if you can win a 6-month or 2-year ad at InkLit.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise/&quot;&gt;Rules for the Ad Contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.santaclaritarealestateblog.com&quot;&gt;Santa Clarita Real Estate Blogger, Linda Slocum&lt;/a&gt;, went above and beyond the call first by being the only commenter on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html&quot;&gt;cleverly re-titled post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up on this, she promoted the contest for me on FaceBook. I&amp;#39;m hoping to do well there. People with their face in a book are a natural for a writing blog!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is RSS, and How Do I Use It?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;RSS stands for &amp;quot;Really Simple Syndication&amp;quot;, and it allows you to subscribe to blogs and news sites you like so you&amp;#39;ll be able to read them whenever they get updated, without having to go check the site to see if there&amp;#39;s anything new. You do this using an RSS reader, which can either be a web site type reader or software that you install on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people say &amp;quot;subscribing&amp;quot;, they simply means adding a site to a reader. Often you can just enter the address of the blog itself into the reader, and it will figure out where the &amp;quot;RSS feed&amp;quot; is. An RSS feed is just a web page in special format that an RSS reader can read. Most blogs have a subscribe link like the one on my blog, and that link is taking you to the RSS feed itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this blog that link looks like this:      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click on this link, you&amp;#39;ll have the option of subscribing in a reader if you already have an RSS reader account set up somewhere. But what if you don&amp;#39;t? Well, let&amp;#39;s try one on, shall we? It won&amp;#39;t take long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Google Reader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s keep it simple and look at one popular RSS reader, Google&amp;#39;s Reader, which is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/reader&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a Google account (Gmail email address), you should have access to this already. If you don&amp;#39;t, click the big blue create an account button and get your free Google account, then when you login you should go straight to the reader. (If not, use the link above again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you enter Google Reader for the first time there&amp;#39;s a short video you can watch if you want, then you&amp;#39;ll want to start adding subscriptions. You should see an &amp;quot;Add Subscription&amp;quot; link on the left hand side of the screen. (Tip: if you don&amp;#39;t see it, look for a gray arrow on the left that will make the left hand navigation window visible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The button should look like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &amp;quot;Add subscription&amp;quot; link and you&amp;#39;ll see a place where you can add the web address for the blog or feed you want to add. (Remember, behind the scenes you&amp;#39;re always adding an &amp;quot;RSS feed&amp;quot;, but most blogs are set up so that if you just add a page or the home page from the blog, it&amp;#39;ll work.) So just copy the web address of the blog you want to add here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add this blog, for example, enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/&quot;&gt;http://www.inklit.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt; and then hit the add button:       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re almost there. You won&amp;#39;t necessarily see anything yet, but if you look at the upper left hand corner of the page, you&amp;#39;ll see a link called &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; right below the Google Reader Icon:      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click that home link and you&amp;#39;ll see that the recent articles for the blog you just added now show up. It&amp;#39;ll look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/image-thumb3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should I Go To All This Trouble Just To Read This Blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if my blog is the only blog you read, you shouldn&amp;#39;t go to all this trouble. You should just come here and read it. Oh, and by the way, thank you, thank you, thank you for your rapt attention. I really appreciate it!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, as compelling as I am (ahem), the chances are you read lots of different blogs and news sites that are updated regularly, and when you read such sites, you want a way to be able to just go to one place and see what&amp;#39;s new. Readers like Google Reader let you go to a single place and read all the news you want to read, and nothing you don&amp;#39;t, without having to manually visit each blog to find out what&amp;#39;s new about the topics of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;ve got your reader set up, your world gets a lot easier. If we visit another web site and click on the subscribe here link, we can add that site as well. Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re over at CatalystBlogger, for example, and you click on Jennifer&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Subscribe Here&amp;quot; link. You&amp;#39;ll end up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/Catalystblogger&quot;&gt;her feed&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll see a bunch of buttons on the right hand side, and if you click the Google button you can add her right into Google Reader easily. Next time you add a feed, you may find a single link that says &amp;quot;Subscribe with Google&amp;quot;, since FeedBurner (the site where many of these RSS feeds live) will remember that you like to use Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now go find your favorite blogs and enjoy reading them! And if you haven&amp;#39;t done so in the tutorial above already, thank you for adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog&quot;&gt;the feed for Inklit.com&lt;/a&gt; to your reader.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Setting Writing Goals is So Important</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Pick up any book about writing or read any blog about writing and you&amp;#39;ll read the same thing over and over again: It&amp;#39;s important to write often, and it&amp;#39;s important to go fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that setting goals is so important is that you&amp;#39;ll end up further ahead of where you would have otherwise. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/06/setting-writing-goals-making-room-for-the-good-stuff/&quot;&gt;Setting Writing Goals, Making Room for the Good Stuff&lt;/a&gt; I talked about the importance of setting goals as a way of making time for the ones that really matter, yet the very next day I noticed that I&amp;#39;d redefined the ones that mattered. Still, what I noticed in the process of setting goals was that I wrote more than I would have otherwise, even though my writing goals were fairly modest. This principle is time honored, and was best expressed in Browning&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Man&amp;#39;s reach should exceed his grasp, or what&amp;#39;s a heaven for?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to non-writing activities, to be sure, such as promoting one&amp;#39;s web site. Shooting for more than I really think I can do (in my heart of underestimating-myself-hearts) is the principle behind trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/&quot;&gt;101 subscribers in 30 days&lt;/a&gt;. How many do I think I would have had at the end of thirty days if I didn&amp;#39;t run this contest? Oh, I don&amp;#39;t know, maybe fifteen. How many do I really think I&amp;#39;ll get? Well, I don&amp;#39;t know. But let&amp;#39;s say I only get fifty. That&amp;#39;s still ahead of where I would have been otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So setting goals is an important productivity tool in the best of times. But what I&amp;#39;ve found is that it&amp;#39;s even more important to have goals in place when conditions are unfavorable. Today, for example, there were several had-to-be-done tasks that knew were going to wreak havoc with the overall schedule, so I had to do two important things. First, I had to revise the goals downward because I knew that otherwise I was just kidding myself completely. But secondly, and more importantly, I had to live up to the goals I finally did set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to say all of this is that setting goals help you go further when you succeed, but equally as important, it helps you lose less ground when you fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true whether you&amp;#39;re writing online, or learning to speak French, or whatever it is you&amp;#39;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day will go by whether you move in a direction or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to make money writing online, when all else fails, write something online.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Jennifer Williamson — Freelance Writing Blog</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Williamson is the proprietor of Catalyst Writing Services, and author one of the first blogs about &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;freelance writing&lt;/a&gt; that I bumped into online.  After a few articles, I was hooked and added her to my feed reader right away.  The first thing that stood out immediately about Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog was the quality of the writing and thinking she put into both her posts and her comments.  Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog is one of the few blogs that I&amp;#39;ve not only subscribed but have also started &amp;quot;reading backwards&amp;quot;.  Her post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/plr-legitimate-business-model-or.html&quot;&gt;PLR writing&lt;/a&gt; inspired a later post of mine, and her &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-post-should-be-simple-and-easy-if.html&quot;&gt;writing scams&lt;/a&gt; article was also a treat.  Jennifer&amp;#39;s blog also has a well maintained and current blog roll that helped me get started on my own resource section and begin learning who my betters are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as if that isn&amp;#39;t enough, Jennifer Williamson also has the distinction of being the first person to ever make bold to write a comment here on Inklit, before anyone knew that writing comments here would become a major Internet pastime.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How To Get 101 Subscribers to Your New Blog in Thirty Days</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream of getting 101 subscribers to this blog within 30 days.  You can help by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;subscribing now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no Martin Luther King or anything, so this is not a big dream, but nevertheless it&amp;#39;s non-trivial.  I have a niche blog that&amp;#39;s almost five years old that doesn&amp;#39;t yet have 101 subscribers.  Getting 101 subscribers to a brand new blog that&amp;#39;s starting with 10 subscribers (YES -- we have reached &lt;strong&gt;double digits&lt;/strong&gt; as of today!) will be a non-trivial accomplishment.  But I think it&amp;#39;s worth shooting for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s March 10th, 2008, as I write this.  I&amp;#39;ll post it on March 11th.  30 days hath September and so on, so by April 10th, I need to be showing 101 Feedburner Subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do You Want More Subscribers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your online writing business model is, you can benefit from having more subscribers.  Especially if selling advertising is part of your business model, a huge subscriber base is an absolute must.  If you&amp;#39;re offering blog ghostwriting or similar services, a blog chock full of subscribers is a work product showing what you can do by way of promoting your client&amp;#39;s business.  If you&amp;#39;re selling information products online, folks who subscribe to blogs are the types of people you want in your target market.  Even niche bloggers may find that having more subscribers will get their articles more attention than they would otherwise, leading to more incoming links and incoming referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Brain-Dead Simple Ten-Part Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eleven part plan I&amp;#39;m using is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;subscribe now&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll get to follow my attempt to reach this goal and you&amp;#39;ll find out if my eleven part plan really works or is all wet.  Either way, though, together we&amp;#39;ll learn techniques for getting more subscribers to our blogs and doing &lt;strong&gt;more business!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready... set ... go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Start where you are.
*&lt;/em&gt;I started out with ten subscribers (Hooray -- I only have to get ninety-one more!).  If you don&amp;#39;t have ten subscribers already, it may take you thirty-two days.  For extra credit it&amp;#39;d be neat if I could get to 111 subscribers by April 10th.  That way I&amp;#39;ll know I added 101 to my original ten.  But let&amp;#39;s be clear:  my base goal is 101 by April 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Start asking people to subscribe on your blog.
*&lt;/em&gt;Start asking people to subscribe at the end of each blog post.  In a post like this talking about your goals, you could make something of a joke or game out of it asking people to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/feed/&quot;&gt;please subscribe&lt;/a&gt; at least three times. OK, that&amp;#39;s three.  I don&amp;#39;t want to annoy you with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix up your feed.&lt;/strong&gt;
Burn your feed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/&quot;&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already.  Fix up your subscription area and make it prominently visible.  Make sure that people can subscribe via RSS or email.  Free services for offering email RSS subscriptions are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedblitz.com/&quot;&gt;Feedblitz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/&quot;&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Put up a FeedBurner subscriber chiclet. *&lt;/em&gt;You want to show how many subscribers you have now.  Don&amp;#39;t worry about those cheesy ten subscribers.  You&amp;#39;ll have 101 in a month.  The past is simply prologue.  Your new subscribers want to see your plan for new subscribers succeed, because if you can do it, so can they!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Offer a free ad.  *&lt;/em&gt;Offer an ad for free for a period of time (three months, six months, one year) for the webmaster who gets you the most new subscribers.   A new ad format that&amp;#39;s very popular is the 125 x 125 pixel format.  I&amp;#39;m going to put up a spot on my blog to host four such ads, and use winning one or more free ad as an incentive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;If you have other blogs or other social networks, use them.  *&lt;/em&gt;(If you don&amp;#39;t, it may take you 101 days or what have you -- use what you have available).  Ways to use your other blog include writing a post linking to your subscription drive.   On social networks, one think I&amp;#39;m going to try is sending a message out to MyBlogLog Community or the like.  Link to your free ad offer and other posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Blog about your subscription drive.
*&lt;/em&gt;Every few days you want to tell people about your subscription drive.  Once every 1-3 days seems about right for the first week, then once every 3-7 days for the rest of the period.  You don&amp;#39;t want to overdo it.  Everyone likes public radio, but everybody hates a telethon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Ramp up your social networking.  *&lt;/em&gt;There are hundreds of social networks out there.  You may already be a member of one or more -- and your friends there miss you and haven&amp;#39;t heard from them in awhile.  Don&amp;#39;t let them down.  Tell them what you&amp;#39;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Email bloggers about your free add offer.  *&lt;/em&gt;You&amp;#39;ll want to use this suggestion with some care, and realize that top bloggers get lots of requests for links, help, etc.  Be polite in your approach, humble about your current blog traffic, and generous in the length of the ad they can win if they help you.  I&amp;#39;ll post a sample email you can use in a future post.  (Hmm . . . how will you be notified when that post comes out?  If only there were a way to see when new blog posts came out for a given blog...).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Ramp up your commenting.  *&lt;/em&gt;Are you meeting new bloggers who might see your ad?  My goal for the period of this promotion is five comments per weekday.  Remember, don&amp;#39;t spam the comments about your program -- your goal in commenting is to participate in other peoples&amp;#39; conversation and get them to stop by your blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Ramp up your posts to other blogs.  *&lt;/em&gt;Maybe someone&amp;#39;s asked you to do a guest post recently, and you&amp;#39;ve been putting it off?  If their blog is about how to promote a blog or has anything to do with online marketing, maybe now&amp;#39;s the time to go write that guest article!  Make sure to mention your free ad offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Selling Your Writing Online (Part II: The Right Way)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/09/selling-your-writing-part-i-the-wrong-way&quot;&gt;Selling Your Writing (Part I: The Wrong Way)&lt;/a&gt; were no doubt waiting for me to get to Part II, where I show you the right way, preferably in 600 words or less, because naturally you&amp;#39;re busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I can do that. Here it is in four words, that I&amp;#39;ve borrowed from David Taylor&amp;#39;s The Freelance Success Book: Write it. Sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty simple, right? Those of you who wanted the short answer are already done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Longer Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if that&amp;#39;s so simple, why isn&amp;#39;t everyone online writing and making money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part one, we talked about five ways to fail, and only one of those ways was about failing to write. All four of the other ways to fail were different ways to fail at selling. So it stands to reason that the much of the rest of our journey, in this article, on this blog, in our careers as people making money by writing online, is going to be about selling, not about writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting better at selling our writing will involve us in two fundamental tasks: exploring markets for our writing and exploiting them. The exploration phase is first -- we need to know approximately where the gold is before we start digging. But even before we go out exploring, it helps to have a basic sort of map of the territory. We can draw a better map as we get more information, but for now let&amp;#39;s divide the world of making money by writing online into six major continents. (We&amp;#39;ll leave off a seventh in case we discover Antarctica later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six Ways To Make Money Writing Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write to Support Sales in Another Business&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;This was the first online writing business model that I learned how to do. In fact, when I first did this, I didn&amp;#39;t know I was a professional writer yet. I thought I was a former software developer who had become a real estate agent. About four years, ten web sites, and eight hundred blog posts later, it dawned on me that my real business was not home sales, but professional writing. Home sales was just a niche and a revenue vehicle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of looking at this business model is that you&amp;#39;re a freelance writer with a single client, where the single client is you, and you get paid strictly on contingency.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Writer For Hire -- The Traditional Freelance Model&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Another time honored way to make money writing online is also a time honored way of making money offline, by being a freelance writer. This is someone who gets paid largely on a per-project basis, either on a fee or fee plus royalty basis. This probably comes closest to capturing what most people think of when they think of professional writers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people probably think of novelists first, but in reality most freelancers make their living selling non-fiction of one form or another. David Taylor&amp;#39;s book, quoted above, is largely about magazine feature publishing. Online variations include web site writer, blog ghostwriter, and the like. Another popular niche in this business model is copy writing, such as writing for direct mail, or the online equivalent, direct response web sites and landing pages.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write An Information Product that Sells Advertising&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;If you can write well enough and often enough and promote yourself well enough to get a significant online readership, you can make a living exclusively from the sale of advertising space on your web site or blog. This can take any number of different forms. AdSense is probably the most popular and well known, but other options include banner ads in a variety of different horizontal and vertical formats. One new format that&amp;#39;s becoming ubiquitous on many blogs is the 125x125 pixel ad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the Internet&amp;#39;s most popular blogs use this approach to good effect. The limitation of this business model is that unless your readership is large enough to support it, the revenue you make from hosting ads on your site is likely to be a trickle of pennies per day at best.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write An Information Product that You Sell Directly&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;In my opinion the single coolest thing about online writing is the extent to which it allows you to be both author and publisher. Do you have a series of blog articles on a topic that could be turned into a book? How about packaging them into an e-book? Yes, there&amp;#39;s the issue of why people would buy material that&amp;#39;s otherwise available free -- part of the exploration we&amp;#39;ll go into on this blog will be how to overcome that. In addition to e-books, there are many other possibilities, such as paid subscription e-newsletters or Internet e-learning. Public Label Rights articles also fall into this category.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write An Information Product that Someone Else Sells For You&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Many of the information products you can sell directly can also be sold by someone else. A $29.95 e-book on my blog may make me $29.95, but if it makes me $9.95 on your blog, that&amp;#39;s fine, too! The main benefit of this approach are that you can get more traffic (and hence -- more sales) than you could if you limit yourself to only selling your material only on your own site. I would be cautious however about using this approach as your sole approach to getting paid online. Sites like Helium and others where you submit your articles and have to participate forever and might get paid someday might be a good low-carb meal for occasional consumption, but if you make them a diet staple I would not be surprised (though I would be saddened) to see you starve.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Some Combination of the Above&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;I believe the best approach to success as an online writer is to cultivate a masterful combination of the techniques listed above. In my own case, for example, item 1 (&amp;quot;Write to support sales in another business&amp;quot;) is the model that is my main source of revenue now, so I&amp;#39;m continuing my work on that area. I am in the process of setting up an online store so I can really work on doing variations on &amp;quot;Write an Information Product That You Sell Directly&amp;quot;, and I can see how a lot of those products might support each other internally as well as serve as promotional pieces leading to freelance work (Item 2). Ad sales are an area I would like to explore further, but I would very much like to learn what&amp;#39;s beyond AdSense and how to create mutually profitable affiliate relationships -- since I think that&amp;#39;s the key to both quality sites and better revenue in the long term. Having said that, however, I am resolved to revisit AdSense for some of my blogs in the short term to see what I can learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Resources for Making Money by Writing Online</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting an article series that will be dedicated to pointing out the online resources that I find most helpful when it comes to the topic of this blog, which is working as a writer online. Because it&amp;#39;s an article series instead of just a collection of links, it will be a little different than a traditional Resources Directory or Blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for the resources directory is to put together perhaps 101 articles (or thereabouts), that collectively will point to the best online resources on a variety of topics that relate to making money as an online writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of resources that you feel should be included on the list, please let me know and I will consider adding them in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Selling Your Writing (Part I: The Wrong Way)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/sleazy-salesman.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/sleazy-salesman-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sleazy_salesman&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Patient, raising his arm a certain way: &amp;quot;Doc, it hurts when I do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor: &amp;quot;Well, don&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to be writers. As in any profession, a small group of superstars make it look glamorous. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t want Steven King&amp;#39;s income? I don&amp;#39;t even know what it is, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I want it. OK, so maybe Steven King&amp;#39;s not glamorous, but he still has more nickels than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are a lot of writers who aren&amp;#39;t Steven King who nevertheless make a decent living -- though I&amp;#39;m sure there are also a lot who are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are superstars, there are those who are just in the profession in one way or another, and there are those who want-to-be-writers. Angela Booth has an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://copywriter.typepad.com/copywriter/2008/03/want-to-write-t.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on her writing blog where she talks about the want-to-be-writers, who fall short of their dreams of writing in the simplest and most time-effective way possible: by not writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, there are several other ways to not make money as a writer. Most of these boil down to either not selling your writing, or not selling it the right way.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of learning how to get paid, let&amp;#39;s brainstorm how to fail at getting paid -- and then not do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Write Anything&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;As we said earlier, this is the simplest way to not making money as a writer. Just don&amp;#39;t write anything. If you&amp;#39;re not going to get paid, this is the fast track. The benefit of this approach is that you free up 100% of your time so presumably you can go get paid for doing something else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my approach to painting. Remember the Bob Ross show about learning how to paint? I used to watch that show and tease my wife that I was a painter -- just a very low producing one.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write for Nothing&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;There are millions of people on the Internet writing for nothing one way or another. In fact, if you had to prove that millions of people want to be writers, the Internet is the most eloquent, real time demonstration you could find, since millions of people like writing so much that they do it for free. In 2006, USA today reported that MySpace had 47.3 million members. I don&amp;#39;t know how many writers Wikipedia has, but I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a fair number given their content. If you write for Wikipedia, you write for nothing, though interestingly enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2007/12/03/wikipedia-paying-illustrators/&quot;&gt;they have started to pay illustrators&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently it&amp;#39;s only us writers who have the strong claim to amateur standing!         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write for Almost Nothing&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;One step up from projects like Wikipedia that pay nothing are projects that pay no money, but offer some (real or imaginary) benefit to the writer, like recognition or incoming links. Don&amp;#39;t read me wrong here: distributing articles and writing on other people&amp;#39;s sites is a time honored way to promote your own web site, especially to the extent you can manage to get your article placed on a site that&amp;#39;s a lot better known than yours is.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the problem comes in is when you confuse what you do for advertising with what you do for a living. Web sites like ActiveRain have thousands of users who will write screenful after screenful of content thinking they are promoting themselves, when often if they&amp;#39;d spent the same amount of time on their own projects they&amp;#39;d have more work than they could do.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, let me offer a new definition for that least-likely-to-have-a-definition phrase, &amp;quot;Web 2.0&amp;quot;. Web 2.0 is a generalized mass hysteria characterized chiefly by the belief that building your web site is more profitable than building mine.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write for Next to Nothing: The Job Boards&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;I almost shut this blog down cold and never looked back the other day, when I took a look at one of the job boards. Wow, really, $12 for an hour&amp;#39;s work? No kidding? Be still my heart! Look, I don&amp;#39;t want to seem elitist here or anything, and if you&amp;#39;re going after twelve dollar per hour jobs and making a go of it, I certainly don&amp;#39;t want to insult your efforts. And as a guy who&amp;#39;s brand new to the freelance writing business, one could argue that I&amp;#39;m simply talking through my hat on the whole issue. But seriously, if professional writing pays twelve dollars per hour, it&amp;#39;s worse than professional typing (which I&amp;#39;ve also done). As a professional typist I can get $12.00 per hour and let Manpower book 40 hour per week gigs -- week after week after week.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Write a Ton and Don&amp;#39;t Sell It for Enough Money&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to get personal here and let you in on a little secret: this is my old business model / ailment. I am in recovery.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of us who are already writing, the person we met at the outset who doesn&amp;#39;t write anything is a total foreigner. We write all the time. So the issue for us is not whether we write at all, because we can&amp;#39;t stop writing. Instead, the issue boils down to this: can we sell enough writing products and services often enough at a high enough price to make the sort of living we aspire to? In my own case, my niche blogging activity already makes me an income that some people in my area make on their full time jobs. Even this year, with the market falling apart, it&amp;#39;s probably more than I&amp;#39;d make as a full time typist, but I am working on doing better. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to Readers from Other Blogs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to quickly welcome those I met on ActiveRain and elsewhere and thank you for the visit!  I&amp;#39;ve been checking out MyBlogLog and it&amp;#39;s nice to see some familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry the content is still such a mixed bag, but I&amp;#39;m working on it!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Journey of 1000 Miles Starts With Gas at $4.00 per Gallon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As you all know, this is a new blog.  I do have some other blogs that I&amp;#39;ve been working on for some time -- the oldest since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inklit is so brand new that we&amp;#39;re still counting the articles here in single digits, and we have &amp;quot;archives&amp;quot; for March -- the month we&amp;#39;re in now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s hardly a reputation yet, it&amp;#39;s more like an indictment.  Yet things are moving along about the same as they always do on a brand new blog.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog&quot;&gt;Feedburner feed&lt;/a&gt; is done, and we&amp;#39;re listed on MyBlogLog.  I was able to chat up Jennifer and get her to stop by.  That was nice.   Google has figured out that we exist and has started indexing us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, nobody knows I&amp;#39;m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s either good news or bad news, depending on your point of view.  As my wife pointed out a few days ago when I complained that I didn&amp;#39;t quite have my subject matter in hand yet, the lack of readership means I can make all the mistakes I want.  A less charitable way to say it would be this:  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much I suck, because no one&amp;#39;s reading me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When In Doubt, Change Your Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being new in a career is a sure fire way to experience a false start or two.  One of the things I remember about my first year in real estate was how many different directions I tried before things started to click for me.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of that going on this blog and in my new writing career as well.  For example, the post that appeared here yesterday about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/06/setting-writing-goals-making-room-for-the-good-stuff/&quot;&gt;setting writing goals&lt;/a&gt; was one that I actually wrote a bit earlier.  Now it&amp;#39;s Friday already, so it&amp;#39;s time for me to think about how it went this week, catch up on the unfinished tasks, and maybe report back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, then, well here&amp;#39;s my report, oh ye who are not yet reading me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as production goes, my blogging production on my various blogs is at about 80% of the goal I set for myself, and I should have it up to 90% or better by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiction goals I set for myself, which in my earlier post I said was &amp;quot;the good stuff&amp;quot; I was making room for, is the one area where I have a big fat goose egg to report.  The opportunity that drove me emotionally and that also consumed most of the time this week was the PLR writing goal.  I spent well over the allotted ten hours on this goal working on setting up a shopping cart system, in the course of which I scraped my knees a few times and found out about three or four different ways that the shopping cart won&amp;#39;t work.  Originally I&amp;#39;d been promising my writing partner that I&amp;#39;d have the cart up and running by Monday, but it&amp;#39;s looking like it&amp;#39;ll slip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In miscellaneous news, I did a creditable job of keeping track of my time for the most part, though I still find I have to force myself to set my timer before I set out writing.  My output varies between about six and fifteen words per minute -- I&amp;#39;m using 10 as a rough idea of what I can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think the idea of setting the goals in writing for the week was worth doing -- and setting them somewhat aggressively was also the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Setting Writing Goals — Making Room for the Good Stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Almost as soon as I resolved to write professionally, I realized that I should start setting goals for my writing and tracking my production and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My need to track my goals and production was not born of self-improvement 101. Instead, this drive to organize my time grew from some minor terrors that had made themselves visitors in my heart, unannounced and certainly unwelcome. Do I have too many projects on my plate? Can I master enough basic skills quickly enough to start making a living? Am I crazy for even trying, or should I just take out some house hunters and scare up an escrow or go back to writing software for someone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, I was afraid that if I didn&amp;#39;t make explicit room for the fiction work, I would tend to ignore it in favor of work that wasn&amp;#39;t so emotionally loaded with uncertainty and risk. So if you need a reason to set goals and track your progress, feel free to steal my reason. Goal setting and progress tracking are a boring, self-imposed task that you do to make room for the good stuff in your writing (whatever &amp;quot;the good stuff&amp;quot; means to you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who might also want to steal my process as well as my motivation, here&amp;#39;s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Got Started Tracking My Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday at Borders I sat down and started writing all my current projects in my journal. For each project, I tried to estimate how much time each one would take. There are several blogs I&amp;#39;m working on, for example, and each of these needed so many posts at so many hours each. Since I&amp;#39;m trying to improve my blog writing while I&amp;#39;m trying to understand the time_ _I spend, and since I have a goal of writing longer posts, I gave myself two hours per blog post. (I know I often bang out shorter works in a half hour, but again, the goal is to go long). Knowing how many posts I want to publish for each blog monthly or weekly, I was able to come up with hours per week per blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I&amp;#39;m running another business, so I entered the number of (non-writing) hours I need to devote to that. There&amp;#39;s some overlap here in my case, because I also blog for my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my current blogging efforts and business, I also wrote down two types of writing that I&amp;#39;m working on writing and selling: short fiction and Private Label Rights articles (including blogging subscription) work. I allocated ten hours per week for each of those categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I was done my list of hours and projects looked something like this, with real blog names in place of &amp;quot;blog 1&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;07 hours blog 1&lt;br&gt;
05 hours blog 2&lt;br&gt;
02 hours blog 3&lt;br&gt;
10 hours fiction work&lt;br&gt;
10 hours PLR work&lt;br&gt;
05 hours existing business&lt;br&gt;
06 hours blog 4        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45 hours total per week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it&amp;#39;s very important to understand that every time you list your goals, you&amp;#39;re working on an experiment for your life that should be short term. Fans of David Allen&amp;#39;s Getting Things Done will recall that one of the most important disciplines he recommends is the weekly review, where you fine tune your list of projects and next actions. I believe a week is an excellent unit of planning, and my goal eventually is to add another ten hour block to the week such as &amp;quot;magazine writing&amp;quot;. It can either replace one of the ten hour blocks that&amp;#39;s there now if an activity doesn&amp;#39;t pan out either emotionally or financially, or I may decide that four blogs is about two or three blogs too many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether forty-five hours is a realistic work week is another open issue. Sure, it&amp;#39;s less than the fifty I had thought would be my maximum, but in practice even forty-five may be overly aggressive. Let&amp;#39;s face it, the first and most destructive thing that happens to any beautiful written schedule is real life. Sure enough, almost to prove the point, the first thing that happened to me on Monday morning with the beautiful schedule I created on Sunday was an email with a potential for about three days worth of paid interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s fine. Next week I will experiment with my life again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking My Production and Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Monday rolled around, I shifted the focus from planning the week to tracking a few core details I wanted to track for each of the projects listed above. I quickly tried out a couple of a task-timer style programs downloaded from the Internet. I&amp;#39;m using AllNetic&amp;#39;s Working Time Tracker for now. If it doesn&amp;#39;t work out, I&amp;#39;ll resort to writing down start times and stop times on a pad, since often the simplest solution is best. (The goal is to start working, not to spend the day fiddling with software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other &amp;quot;tracking tool&amp;quot; that I put together in a few seconds was a brain dead simple Excel Spread sheet with the following column headers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article / Post / Story / Task&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time Spent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first column is meant to record whatever title I worked on, or it can be a task, in which case it&amp;#39;s just a note reminding me of what I was doing. The second column is the project or blog (from the list above). Date is of course the date the work was done, and time spent is simply the elapsed time for that task that day. Next come the number of words written. Finally, quality is simply a subjective letter grade for the story or work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever system you set up and use, make sure it&amp;#39;s simple and easy to use. It can be as easy as a diary. Getting organized is not an end in itself, and it should never be so complex that it detracts from the good stuff. The goal of setting goals is to distract from the good stuff, but to give it the time it needs to flower and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Missing Geek Found. Search Party Unimpressed.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Occasional Internet real estate marketing blogger, John Lockwood, who had been missing from his blog for several weeks, was found today at his keyboard. Doctors commented that for someone suffering from exposure, he looked surprisingly well fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescue team that was sent out to find Lockwood had little comment on the discovery. Rescue dog handler, Norbert Dimwhistle, had this to say about his dogs&amp;#39; discovery: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. Usually when the dogs sniff someone out, they get all excited and bark their heads off. With Lockwood they just curled up nearby and went to sleep. I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s all that exciting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi There, John Lockwood Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like &amp;quot;The Onion&amp;quot; won&amp;#39;t be hiring any new writers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January and February were somewhat busy months in real estate, with me working with several buyers of my own -- sometimes productively and sometimes not. So part of the answer to the question of where I&amp;#39;ve been has been that I&amp;#39;ve been selling a house and driving around a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as things wound down a bit at the end of February, naturally I couldn&amp;#39;t just show up here and work on business interest #2. No, dumb time-management school dropout that I am, at that point I had to stick another iron in the fire, a brand new blog about writing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklit.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Inklit.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I almost forgot: while I was missing I also invented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogsview/399971/To-Learn-More-Clique&quot;&gt;Real Estate Johnosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Warren Buffet remarked famously: Diversification is for the ignorant. I plead guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know why he&amp;#39;s a billionaire and I put search and rescue dogs to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>PLR Writing Basics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I began blogging about writing as a career partly to have a journal of my writing work, but even more importantly as a personal exploration into writing markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first new ideas I bumped into was the concept of PLR writing. PLR stands for &amp;quot;Private Label Rights&amp;quot;. PLR articles are written once and then sold to multiple web site owners, each of whom purchases the rights to use the article as is or modify it as needed and then &amp;quot;privately label&amp;quot; the article as their own. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/68423/understanding_private_label_rights.html&quot;&gt;Courtney Ramirez points out&lt;/a&gt;, PLR articles are commonly sold as filler for Adsense web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelance writer and trainer Angela Booth has also written extensively about PLR writing, including her article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabwritersezine.com/ezine-issues/article-fortunes-issue-39-29/&quot;&gt;Writing and Selling PLR Content&lt;/a&gt;. Angela&amp;#39;s article does a great job of making the case for PLR content as an first rate business model for an online writing career. She also gets into more detail than Ramirez on the PLR licensing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone likes PLR. To answer the PLR critics, CatalystBlogger&amp;#39;s Jennifer Williamson wrote a fine article recently entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/plr-legitimate-business-model-or.html&quot;&gt;PLR: Legitimate Business Model or Morally Bankrupt&lt;/a&gt;. Jennifer examines some of the controversy among Freelance writers surrounding PLR articles. As a real estate broker in my other life, much of this debate reminds me of the debate around discount brokers. As Jennifer points out, one of the problems with PLR writing is that it&amp;#39;s cheap. So at least part of the backlash against PLR articles stems from a purely financial consideration: people can pay less for them than for custom work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in my exploration, my own position is that I&amp;#39;m fairly ambivalent about PLR. On the one hand, the combination of writing SEO-optimized copy together with the opportunity to distribute my work online is a natural fit for my current background as a real estate web site author/webmaster/blogger. On the other hand, at least a part of my motivation for exploring new writing outlets was that I wanted to escape the daily grind of &amp;quot;pimping to the search engines&amp;quot;. That being the case, you&amp;#39;d be hard pressed to find a worse example of &amp;quot;moving in the wrong direction&amp;quot; than becoming a PLR Guru. Just call me Stephen King to the Sploggers. (Or is that Gore Vidal of Viagra?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say PLR&amp;#39;s wrong for everyone. I certainly don&amp;#39;t find fault with those for whom it&amp;#39;s a lucrative living. I&amp;#39;m not even saying it&amp;#39;s wrong for me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it an interesting addition to the march of business models.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Am I Writing or Am I Blogging, And What’s The Difference?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d no sooner written my first post here than I began to look for other blogs who had more than one post plus hello world put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of them, and it looks like I&amp;#39;m late to the party. That&amp;#39;s all right. I just hope there&amp;#39;s still food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more &amp;quot;writing blogs&amp;quot; than there are &amp;quot;real estate blogs&amp;quot;, at least according to Google. The difference is approximately twenty-one million to fourteen million. Or make that 3:2 times seven million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lot of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I looked around to see who was early to the writing-about-writing party, I realized that I&amp;#39;d stopped writing and started blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s The Difference Between Blogging and Other Writing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Social Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I look at blogging as a sort of party-drunk edge of writing. Writing by its nature is somewhat solitary, whereas much of blogging always seems to run the risk of devolving into a cocktail party on a good day, or a brawl on a bad one. This is not to say that blogging is not a legitimate writing career path. My own writing career is being sponsored by my blogging revenue.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It Combines the Role of Author and Publisher&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;One way to look at blogging is that it is a form of sweat-equity self-publishing. As the publisher as well as the writer, you spend a lot of time on sales, promotion, and distribution -- work that a lot of time feels dangerously like &amp;quot;mere socializing&amp;quot;. Much of our activity as bloggers serves the same sales-related function as a book signing or author interview would in traditional publishing.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its Often -- Though Not Always -- of Poor Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because blogs are not vetted in any way and needn&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; to a publisher or editor before they appear, there&amp;#39;s a huge variation in quality among them. I don&amp;#39;t mean to idealize print writing as some sort of uniform quality utopia, but editors, agents and publishers do serve an important function of quality control that simply disappears in an online environment.         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It May Not Even Have a Human Reader In Mind&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;One of the functions of blogging that has fed me quite well in some of my work is establishing my expertise and credibility on a topic not for human consumption, but for computer algorithms -- notably search engines. I suppose that writing pieces meant to promote the author somehow are nothing new, but I can&amp;#39;t think of any historical parallel where a writer sought the approval of a mechanism. This is just plain weird. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s Beyond Blogging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the domain names I considered using for this site promoted the idea that this blog would be about forms of writing that are outside of or beyond mere blogging. In the end I&amp;#39;m quite happy that I didn&amp;#39;t take the blog in that direction, but I am trying to see how well, and to what extent, blogging fits into my overall writing career. I don&amp;#39;t see any need to bite a hand that&amp;#39;s fed me just because other hands beckon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase an old sixties joke about drugs and reality, above all I hope that blogs are not just a crutch for those who can&amp;#39;t handle fiction. I&amp;#39;m not sure that spending some time working on fiction and continuing to blog are mutually exclusive. I made a fair amount of progress on two stories and discarded a third in about ten hours or so. I see no reason to lock myself in at this stage. On a strictly business level, picking one or two areas to try to master may be far more productive than trying to take on the whole field in a hot week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, look, let&amp;#39;s start crossing stuff off: no poetry or novels in 2008 unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I feel more focused already.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to InkLit.com</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Inklit is a blog about writing as a career. It has just come into the world like any newborn, slick and helpless and stupid about what it will become. As though struggling for oxygen, it&amp;#39;s the wrong shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inklit was born at 11:00 AM on Saturday, March 1st, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an idea about my writing career, and my idea gave Inklit life. I already have a career as a professional writer of sorts. I am a blogger, pimping used houses to the search engines. This pays the bills, but all by itself it&amp;#39;s not very satisfying. So I thought I would enjoy doing more with my writing career and my life. With this idea, I began to write some stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that I would share what I learn about writing as a career gave Inklit life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you haven&amp;#39;t made any money writing yet. Or maybe like me you&amp;#39;ve done some writing as a career, and now you want to get better at your writing work, and explore new formats and new markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what this blog is about. Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Highrise Review - HighriseHQ Contact Relationship Manager</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the elusive goals that I&amp;#39;ve had for my business for many years is to improve our customer service and our follow-up on leads while centralizing my company&amp;#39;s database of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I was very excited this week when I took a second look at 37signal&amp;#39;s product &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highrisehq.com&quot;&gt;HighRise&lt;/a&gt;. The first time I looked at HighRise it struck me as a bit simplistic, but this time around it dawned on me that I may have found a solution that does about 99% of what I expect and need it to do, and does it elegantly and affordably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking IHomeFinder Leads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core features of HighRise is its ability to work superbly well with email. Elite Properties has several real estate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlockwood.com/profile/#WebSites&quot;&gt;web sites&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#39;ve developed over the years, and all the most productive ones are running IHomefinder IDX. For some time now the workflow has looked like: leads come in to my computer, and I either handle them myself or have my email software (Eudora) forward them to the agent on duty. This works tolerably well, but as a broker needless to say I&amp;#39;m always looking out for a way to increase our conversion rate, and I also want to know that the leads my company has spent lots of time developing (through hard earned blogging / SEO sweat equity) are followed up efficiently. Moreover, the system falls down somewhat if an agent is out on a listing appointment or showing property, since when that happens the leads tend to just sit in their inbox all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem brings us to a core feature of HighRise, the &amp;quot;dropbox&amp;quot;, which is a kind of intelligent mailbox that can read incoming email that&amp;#39;s forwarded to it, figure out who it was forwarded from, and either create a new record for that contact or add the email information to the existing contact. So now instead of forwarding to the agents, which I was already doing, I can simply tell Eudora to forward them to HighRise, and Highrise will instantly create a contact record for the lead, or add it to the contact history that already exists. It doesn&amp;#39;t get every field in the right place (such as phone numbers in the lead), but since the email text is sent along with it, it&amp;#39;s easy to just paste things into the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to email tracking, HighRise allows you to very easily keep notes on conversations and calls, and track tasks you might want to schedule such as follow up calls or emails or property showings. The UI design is mostly elegantly simple and uncluttered, with the tools right where you need them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag, You&amp;#39;re It!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HighriseHQ you can &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; a contact with pretty much any keyword you want, and the tags are pretty much like the blog tags that many of my readers here will be familiar with from &amp;quot;Tag Clouds&amp;quot;. One of the uses I like for Tags is that it allows me to assign a lead to an individual using their name, or to mark it as &amp;quot;Open&amp;quot; so the first agent to be available can claim it. No doubt once you get in to the software you&amp;#39;ll find lots of uses for tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Down Side&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HighRise lives and dies by simplicity. The fact that it does a few things extremely well and poses a practically non-existent learning curve is a core feature. On the other hand, once in awhile you find yourself wishing it would do some things better or be a bit more configurable. Although there&amp;#39;s an API available for developers, if you&amp;#39;re a non-programming power user you&amp;#39;ll find that you either like what it does, or you don&amp;#39;t, because you aren&amp;#39;t going to be changing it much. I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of this comes from its developers being a Ruby on Rails shop. Ruby on Rails is a web development tradition noted for an extreme minimalism. This can be great on a tools level, but one might argue that minimalism outlives its usefulness when it seeps into the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature I would like, for example, relates to upcoming tasks. When you create tasks, they show up in a view that tells you what&amp;#39;s scheduled today, next week, later, etc., and the dates are displayed (without days of the week!) but as soon as you have four or five tasks in there, you find yourself wishing for a calendar view so you can see them graphically. Another feature that would be nice is to display times along with dates for notes and contact creation. Also, HighRise&amp;#39;s dropboxes work fine with plain text emails, but they strip links out of HTML emails. As a result, those easy-to-use links that IHomefinder provides to log in and see what homes a potential client is looking at go away. A workaround for that is to also forward the lead to a separate shared email account, but naturally that&amp;#39;s a bit of a hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, for me the simplicity and ease of use of HighRise and its ability to &amp;quot;do the right thing&amp;quot; with a new lead far outweigh the features it lacks. Add to that the fact that getting a team of a half dozen agents up and running will set you back only about $24 per month compared to $210 per month for Top Producer, and HighRise&amp;#39;s minimalism becomes if anything even more exciting. We&amp;#39;re in the middle of rolling it out and I will let you know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internet Marketing Week In Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found lots of lists of more reading to do. It&amp;#39;s amazing how a few hours with populating a good feed reader with great feeds can quickly pile up to more reading than you can possibly keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Build Quality Links&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;You may have heard that along with great content, good quality incoming links are essential to a successful search engine optimization campaign. There are dozens of ways to go about this, and Sergey Rusak, an SEO specialist in Boston, has published an excellent list to get you started in his article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techwebmedia.com/2008/01/04/52-ways-to-get-quality-link&quot;&gt;52 Ways to Get Quality Links&lt;/a&gt;. (I think English is Sergey&amp;#39;s second language -- nevertheless the resources collected there are awesome). For that article, we have a hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/sobcon-be-there-for-the-business-of-blogging&quot;&gt;Lorelle on Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; (and by the way, though we may not be attending SOBCon -- I&amp;#39;ve found Lorelle&amp;#39;s blog to be always worth a trip). Remember when embarking on a link building strategy to always keep in mind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769&quot;&gt;Google&amp;#39;s Webmaster Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and their page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=66356&quot;&gt;Link Schemes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Brushing Up Your SEO&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Writing for the Online Marketing Blog, Lee Odden covered the winners in Search Engine Journal&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toprankblog.com/2008/01/best-search-marketing-blogs-2007/&quot;&gt;Search Engine Marketing Blog Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Social Networking Software&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;Those of you who found my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/04/reductio-ad-myspace&quot;&gt;critique of Ning.com&lt;/a&gt; to be a bit over the top and who are looking for a serious review of some social networking software solutions may want to check out this review of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/9-ways-to-build-your-own-social-network/&quot;&gt;Ning, Kickapps and other social networking software&lt;/a&gt;. After John Jantsch stopped by last week I saw he was running a social network on Kickapps, so I stopped by there to give it a spin. So far I&amp;#39;ve found Ning to be a bit more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Real Estate FAQ&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;As he always does, Phoenix Real Estate guy Jay Thompson has done a good job implementing a real estate marketing idea that you sometimes see surfacing on other sites, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoenixrealestateguy.com/latest-blogsperiment-the-real-estate-faq/626&quot;&gt;Real Estate FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. Such in depth real estate coverage may help you with &amp;quot;long tail&amp;quot; search results, and help to establish your expertise to your clients and your site&amp;#39;s relevance to the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy -- Author&#39;s Guide</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you been successful in your real estate or lending career largely (or partially) because of your Internet marketing?   Our &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&amp;quot; series (see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;) highlights authors who are using the Internet to close more business.  You don&amp;#39;t have to have an &amp;quot;Internet-only&amp;quot; marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we&amp;#39;ll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we&amp;#39;re looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest authors of course will have their own byline and appropriate links in their article.  (I recommend no more than five self-serving links, and no more than eight links overall).  If you&amp;#39;re interested in contributing, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and let&amp;#39;s discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article goes into some questions and guidelines that may be helpful to you as a guest author in our &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s Your Internet Marketing Strategy&amp;quot; series.  You don&amp;#39;t have to answer any particular questions an certainly not all of them, but you may find that going over the list will help you to come up with ideas to round out your article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is the Internet to your overall marketing plan?  Is it the only kind of marketing you do, or is it just one of many strategies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What percentage of your business can you trace to Internet marketing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What companies have helped you with your Internet marketing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What role if any does your personal web site(s) play in your marketing strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What role if any does your blog (s) in your marketing strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of the following (if any) have been important to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic search engine optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link building or reciprocal linking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay per click advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other traffic generation (banner ads, directories, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay for lead services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you use social networking services (if at all)?  Social networking services include ActiveRain, Facebook, LinkedIn, Myspace, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many closed transactions can you trace back directly to social networking services?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important are having online listings to your strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have visitors register for listings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What types of leads does your web site generate?  Which of these have you had the most success at closing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you consider the strengths of your online marketing program?  What do you think could be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do in the way of short-term follow-up?  How fast do you respond to your leads on average?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What types of long-term follow-up systems do you have?  Do you do any drip marketing other than sending listings (a newsletter, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How cost effective is Internet marketing compared to other forms of marketing you&amp;#39;ve done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Feed Statistics for Wordpress Without Feedburner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just installed Chris Fink&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisfinke.com/wordpress/plugins/feed-statistics/&quot;&gt;Feed Statistics Plugin&lt;/a&gt; to test it out here after finding yet another group of RSS screen scrapers stealing the content of another blog of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I realize that for many of my readers I probably skipped a whole bunch of technical steps and background info there, so let me fill in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, RSS Feeds are a kind of machine readable version of your blog.  The fact that they&amp;#39;re machine readable means that folks can subscribe to them in an RSS reader, like Bloglines or Google Reader for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a video that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videojug.com/film/rss-in-plain-english&quot;&gt;breaks it down&lt;/a&gt; if all this is greek to you so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most blogging systems have a feed you can subscribe to like this.   Your ActiveRain blog has one for example.  (Scroll down and look for little links on the bottom right that say &amp;quot;RSS&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Atom&amp;quot; -- those are links to two flavors of RSS feed for your ActiveRain blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, well now fast forward.  If people who read blogs are gradually learning how to do this, eventually people who write blogs going to want to find out how many subscribers they have, and how many times people click through to their site.  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com&quot;&gt;Feedburner.com&lt;/a&gt;, a free site that will &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; a new feed -- which means it&amp;#39;ll take your original feed that doesn&amp;#39;t have support for statistics and turn it into a new feed that DOES have support for statistics.  Now you can find out that your article about Possum Gulch Luxury Homes was hugely successful, and bask in the sheer glory of it while writing more articles about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good.  You have your feed on Feedburner, and you&amp;#39;re finding out what a Possum Gulch superstar you are.  All&amp;#39;s well and good.  But what if you don&amp;#39;t want your feed hosted on a third party web site?  For example, what if (like me) you find out that someone has taken your feed and published all your content somewhere else, but because your feed is now on Feedburner, there&amp;#39;s no good technical way to shut them down.  (Of course, there are legal solutions because clearly it&amp;#39;s a copyright violation, but it&amp;#39;d be nice if you could shut them down another way -- which you could do if the feed were hosted on your own site, but how you do that is a whole different story, with the short answer being: &amp;quot;ask a nerd&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, because of some disreputable criminals, I have to jump through hoops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t the Internet great?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Week In Review - Focus on Lead Generating Companies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I announced a new guest author series entitled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s Your Internet Real Estate Marketing Strategy?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; The point of that series is to hear from Realtors® who are successful in their online marketing efforts but who have a view of Internet marketing that&amp;#39;s different from mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways it&amp;#39;s possible to be successful online that&amp;#39;s about as different as it can be from the way I do it is to use online lead reseller companies like HomeGain.com. On Monday I&amp;#39;ll have an article that talks about how my own Internet marketing evolution is a response against a &amp;quot;lead reseller&amp;quot; agent in my office, and how I swung to the other extreme to become highly focused on Search Engine Optimization and content development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, this week I started looking into information about these companies and looking for Realtors® with an opinion on them one way or another. Minnesota&amp;#39;s Josyln Panka sparked an excellent discussion, the comments of which serve as a sort of introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogsview/92968/HomeGain-anyone-familiar&quot;&gt;Realtor® opinions about HomeGain&lt;/a&gt;. One commenter there, Nevada Broker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://suenelsonteam.com&quot;&gt;Sue Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, had some very positive things to say about her HomeGain results, so I stopped by and invited her to talk about her marketing strategy in our forthcoming series. Another person weighing in on this thread was Louis Cammarosano, HomeGain&amp;#39;s general manager. Googling his name will bring you to all sorts of other interesting links about HomeGain versus Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former HomeGain Sales Director Chris Hendricks defended HomeGain&amp;#39;s switch to a monthly-subscription model for its AgentEvaulator product by discussing an absolutely crucial element to successful online marketing -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogsview/61401/Different-Vantages-Yield-Vastly&quot;&gt;successful follow-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best single source for discussion of HomeGain and other lead generation companies that I found was on Realtown.com&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realtown.com/LeadGeneration/blog/&quot;&gt;Lead Generation Blog&lt;/a&gt;. An excellent guide to who the players are is the &amp;quot;View by Vendor&amp;quot; blogroll on the left hand side, and the articles here are a good mix of criticisms of the Lead Generation companies and success stories.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Was the Social Internet Before It Was Social?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the anti-social Internet, where nothing was connected to anything and no one communicated using it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its outset, the Internet has been about people sharing and communicating information and ideas.  In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee first conceived of a hypertext project at CERN as a means for researchers information.  In August of 1991 the first web site was put online at CERN, and we&amp;#39;ve been all typing up a storm ever since.  In addition to web sites and the tools to browse them, the first killer app of the Internet was e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to email and web sites, electronic bulletin board systems (BBSs) like the ones I frequented on Fidonet in the eighties were, as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; correctly points out, a precursor to the World Wide Web.  You could say that we had a social Internet before we had an Internet, and the latter was just a bunch of protocols to run it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter The Web 2.0 Now Here&amp;#39;s Something We Hope You&amp;#39;ll Really Like Social Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few years a lot of people have been spending a great deal of time on various social networking sites.  In 2006, Myspace allegedly reached the 100 million user mark -- a number that at least one geek has &lt;a href=&quot;http://forevergeek.com/articles/debunking_the_myspace_myth_of_100_million_users.php&quot;&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt;.  The popular real estate social networking site, ActiveRain,  also launched in 2006, and many agents and brokers including me have invested (squandered?) a great deal of time there.  More recently, I&amp;#39;ve been amazed by how many messages I have whenever I log in at Facebook or Cre8Buzz or one of the other social networks I&amp;#39;ve participated in -- and I&amp;#39;m not really that popular a guy.  Ann Cummings invites me to use FunWall.  David Smith pokes me.  Oliver Muoto received a can of Whoop Ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For awhile there I was getting email daily updates from Facebook, telling me the most inane things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned that off eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Criticisms of the Social Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s Amateur, in the sense that you don&amp;#39;t get paid for it.
*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/&quot;&gt;Andrew Keen&lt;/a&gt; has probably written more about this criticism than anyone.  As a corollary, I agree with this argument, insofar as I&amp;#39;ve made a decent living off of several web sites I&amp;#39;ve created and maintained, but no money at all off of ActiveRain.  Even the referrals I&amp;#39;ve received have not come from ActiveRain, but from people finding my own web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Someone&amp;#39;s might be getting paid for it, but it won&amp;#39;t be you.
*&lt;/em&gt;One of the most amusing incidents in Move.com&amp;#39;s failed acquisition of ActiveRain was this ActiveRain apologia about &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/&quot;&gt;who owns the content on ActiveRain&lt;/a&gt;.  Still, I don&amp;#39;t recall any discussion about how the thirty-million would have been shared if the transaction went through.  Oh.  See also, this article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/10/creating-your-own-internet-real-estate/&quot;&gt;remodeling the kitchen in a house you rent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s Amateur, in the sense of incompetent or unskilled
*&lt;/em&gt;Think:  Myspace web pages.  Pink on purple, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s Amateur, in the sense of trivial or unimportant
*&lt;/em&gt;OK, this one&amp;#39;s almost built in.  In order to socialize, human beings have to lighten up a bit on their seriousness.  Still, it does seem to me that one can base an adult friendship on banter a bit more sophisticated than throwing sheep at one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;You Can&amp;#39;t Optimize for Every Web Site There Is
*&lt;/em&gt;Every web site has its own rules for getting to a top ranked listing.  I prefer to shoot for the top of Google, Yahoo, and MSN in that order.  These are sites that buyers and sellers use when they&amp;#39;re buying and selling, not socializing.  Yes, this means I&amp;#39;ve had to give up my coveted #2 spot on ActiveRain.  So far I haven&amp;#39;t noticed a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s Anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;
Having their cake and eating it too, social Internet socialites believing in the absolute sanctity of open information (thou shalt not ever censor me), even if they don&amp;#39;t sign their names or take responsibility for their actions.  Human-Powered Search Engine Mahalo goes a step further and recommends that instead of a photo of your human self, you &amp;quot;Be Cool&amp;quot; and use a Wee-Me Avatar instead.  Apparently being Human-Powered wasn&amp;#39;t cool enough in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;It Confuses Grouchiness with Erudition
*&lt;/em&gt;With a hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Vicomte_de_Chateaubriand/&quot;&gt;Quote of the Day&lt;/a&gt; and the Vicomte de Chateaubriand (famous consumer of steak), &amp;quot;You Are Not superior just because you see the world in an odious light&amp;quot;.  And yes, I do apply that criticism to myself as well, and see this as one of my less useful posts.  I can never get enough of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1771556&quot;&gt;Internet Commenter Business Meeting&lt;/a&gt;.  To be sure, that&amp;#39;s not new, either.  We had the same sort of thing going on in Fidonet.  To puree a metaphor, there&amp;#39;s something about sitting behind a keyboard without a real face in front of you that makes it harder to wag your tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Windows Live Writer Tutorial</title>

				<title>Has Your Copyright Been Violated?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the certainties of the Internet is that if you write long enough, some idiot will eventually try to steal your material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember grade school, where the world was divided into people who did their homework so they&amp;#39;d be able to pass the test, and those who tried to copy the answers?  Well sure enough, the world is still divided that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning when I logged into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events&quot;&gt;Sacramento Real Estate Blog&lt;/a&gt; I found an incoming link to one of my posts, and the title of the link was a jumbled title based on the original title of the post.  Sure enough, when I went over to check out the post, everything except the title had been copied verbatim from the original post.  Not only had this moron copied my post -- they copied what I consider to have been one of the worst posts I&amp;#39;ve written in several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Google has a relatively &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/blogger_dmca.html&quot;&gt;easy way to respond to copyright violations&lt;/a&gt; on that you find on Blogger blogs (typically with a URL like ImAnIdiotCopyingYourWork.blogspot.com).  I&amp;#39;ve read other bloggers complain that the process takes some time because you have to submit the request by mail or fax, but I just submitted a complaint following the instructions there, and it took no more than about twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mortgage Broker Blog -- Client Testimonial</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Peter Thompson, author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Illinois Mortgage Rates and News&lt;/a&gt;, was kind enough to write testimonial below and send it along over the weekend.  Wow, this is really nice.  I appreciate you putting this together, Pete.  It was a pleasure working with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are even thinking about starting your own blog site, you need to talk with John Lockwood. John helped me with my blog, Illinois Mortgage Rates and News. When I started blogging on Active Rain a couple of months back, I felt I was really on to something. I was new to blogging, but I knew the mortgage market and writing was both a hobby and a compulsion. This seemed like the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Active Rain is that it is a great resource for information about anything related to real estate, including real estate marketing. I knew nothing about blogging or search engine optimization but I found several experts in the community and read everything I could find to get me up to speed on the ways to make my blog a success. The posts on John’s blog, Elite Properties Sacramento were a real help and he was one of my first subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more, it seemed that starting my own stand-alone blog was the best way to gain an audience and increase my exposure in my target market. I made a couple of calls to experts I found on Active Rain. One of the calls was to a leading name in the industry. A representative called back and we had a nice conversation. He emphasized how their company trained bloggers by teaching them to blog from the ground up with a several month long course with a set lesson plan. It sounded interesting, but my impression was that they had a one size fits all program, and I wasn’t sure it fit my needs. My other concern was the price. He quoted a number high enough to make me gasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, I came across a post on Active Rain from a Realtor who was thinking of starting her own blog but had no clue on how to start. In the comments section, John said that he was expanding his business into this area. I knew John from reading his blog and I respected his expertise, so I decided to give him a call. We hit it off and I knew right away that he was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first goal was to get the blog site set up and running, but he offered much more. By researching key words he was able to give me some targets where I had a chance to dominate in my competitive market. He listened to my goals and helped me to devise a strategy for long term success. We talked about ways to promote my blog and build traffic as well as what I needed to do to get ranked higher with the search engines. It was a lot of information, but it was focused on my specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John had the technical knowledge to make the most of setting up the site. He helped me pick a Wordpress template that was easy to use and easy to read. He customized the template with my personal info, added widgets, set up contact boxes and a navigation bar that integrated my blog with my web site and optimized the site for search engine traffic. The site looks great, better than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John got me off to a great start. Long term success is up to me, but I don’t know where I would be if I tried to do this on my own. If you are even thinking of starting a new blog you really should give him a call.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internet Marketing Week In Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t usually like blogs with a lot of Adsense ads staring you in the face. However, I did enjoy Brandon Cornett&amp;#39;s article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.armingyourfarming.com/&quot;&gt;How to Write a Real Estate Ad - Magazine Ad Writing 101&lt;/a&gt;. Too often we speak in generalities like &amp;quot;excellent customer service&amp;quot;, and Brandon talks about how to get down to specific real estate stories of interest and calls to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon&amp;#39;s example of an online real estate forum is an interesting idea and might be useful as a lead incubation strategy. One reason I&amp;#39;ve never launched such a forum myself, however, is the issue of size. I wonder if one can run a successful forum when the number of people buying or selling a home is fairly small. Even in a great month in my area, for example, there are only a couple of thousand homes changing hands. I guess on the one hand you don&amp;#39;t care how many people are there, as long as some of them turn into customers, but to me the most interesting forums are the ones with lots of members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of interesting forums, RealEstateWebmasters.com just announced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatewebmasters.com/blogs/morgan-carey/3584/show/&quot;&gt;fairly major upgrade&lt;/a&gt; to their free real estate blogs. Real Estate Webmasters blogs provide an excellent opportunity to showcase your content, and they have very good search engine authority as well so you might link back to your other site from your Real Estate Webmaster blog. Don&amp;#39;t overdo it, though -- remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769&quot;&gt;Google Webmaster Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, ActiveRain recently announced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogsview/295869/ActiveRain-outside-blogs-sneak&quot;&gt;sneak preview&lt;/a&gt; of their new outside blogs. I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll sell a lot of them if they price them right, because they have the ideal audience for such an upsell, but I do admit I take issue with two items on their feature list. First is the idea of not learning a new blogging platform. Well, that&amp;#39;d be ok if their platform was the superior one, but I imagine I might get Pete Thompson to vouch for how much easier the Livewriter / Wordpress combination is to use, and the latest (finally not beta) version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1442.entry&quot;&gt;Live Writer&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to set up for your Wordpress blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the outside blog announcement said, &amp;quot;You will be able to benefit from the SEO knowledge and power of ActiveRain.&amp;quot; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogsview/292215/Differing-Google-Strategies-for&quot;&gt;myth of ActiveRain&amp;#39;s SEO mojo&lt;/a&gt; is an oft-repeated one -- Mike Jones boasts that &amp;quot;Active Rain works (brings Google to your door) regardless of your ability to write or your desire to blog&amp;quot;. Wow, that&amp;#39;s not only incredible, it&amp;#39;s not credible. Mike cites his Tucson area colleagues, including Marsee Wilhems, &amp;quot;one of Tucson&amp;#39;s most successful REALTORS&amp;quot;. OK, I&amp;#39;ll bite, let&amp;#39;s see where the first ActiveRain blog is for the key words &amp;quot;Tucson real estate&amp;quot;, shall we? I tried &amp;quot;Tucson Real Estate&amp;quot; on Google, and got to page 10 without finding ActiveRain anywhere. (And yes, I tried &amp;quot;localism&amp;quot;, too. If any true believers wants to begin the hunt for ActiveRain results starting at page 11, let me know). I&amp;#39;m sure Marsee Williams is successful, but I suspect her success is minimally related to ActiveRain&amp;#39;s content-free Google fairy dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet, folks, sorry. The alternatives are: open wallet, pay Google or Yahoo, or massive content published over a long period of time combined with sensible link building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the week in review. Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Illinois Mortgage Blog Coming Along Nicely</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On a business level, I&amp;#39;m so passionate about Internet marketing because it works so well.  But underneath it all, what really drives me is that I get such a boyish geek kick out of watching new web sites start to take off and start to be able to make their owners money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally it gives me great pleasure to see how successful Pete Thompson&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Illinois Mortgage Rates and News&lt;/a&gt; is in after only a short time.  We&amp;#39;ve been having a phone conference every other day or so to get his new blog established, and it&amp;#39;s really fun to see the creativity and humor he brings to bear.  For example, in a recent post, Pete &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/2007/12/05/despite-what-youve-heard-mortgage-companies-are-still-in-the-business-of-lending-money/&quot;&gt;dispelled the myth&lt;/a&gt; that mortgage brokers have packed it in and no one&amp;#39;s getting loans any more.  (This point is less obvious than it appears.  Listening to some of my clients, I&amp;#39;m beginning to think that tales of people not qualifying for loans have taken on the status of urban legends!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pete&amp;#39;s already had a few people stop by and comment, and he&amp;#39;s indexed by some of the more important blog search engines and social networking services, and Google&amp;#39;s started picking up his content as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really gets me excited as well is that he&amp;#39;s well on his way (we&amp;#39;ll do a few more tweaks over the next few days), and he was able to accomplish this for about 1/6th the cost of one of my competitors.  So in the first year, he&amp;#39;ll save some $2,800** **for the same results, and he&amp;#39;ll continue to save year after year on his web hosting bill.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Please Don&#39;t Disconnect the Blogger&#39;s Internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It makes him all soggy and hard to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of days I&amp;#39;ve been troubleshooting my Internet connection, which appears to have decided not to behave reliably any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go out on a limb and say I&amp;#39;ve solved it, since it&amp;#39;s behaving reliably now, but it&amp;#39;ll take another day or two to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are words of wisdom from an amateur network admin:  95% of the time, it&amp;#39;s a cable problem.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mortgage Blogging Client</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pleased to announce that I&amp;#39;m currently beginning work on a blog installation and training program for for Peter Thompson, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptmortgage.com/ng.html&quot;&gt;Chicago Loan Officer&lt;/a&gt;. Peter and I met through a comment I made on ActiveRain and we hit it off right away, because I was able to provide him with a low cost and personalized set of services to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the Search Engine Optimization of his existing web site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research effective key words to use for his web site and blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a Wordpress blog based on a standard template, with some customization to the template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggest strategies for blogging topics, attracting more visitors (both customers and colleagues that can contribute to the blog&amp;#39;s success), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on some of the writing I&amp;#39;ve seen from him both on his newly launched site and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://activerain.com/blogs/pt1111&quot;&gt;Active Rain blog&lt;/a&gt; and his &amp;quot;in it for the long haul&amp;quot; attitude, I expect that it won&amp;#39;t be long before his new blog will ultimately serve as a major resource for Illinois home finance information.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cre8Buzz -- An Early Look</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been known to be somewhat ambivalent about Social networks (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/04/reductio-ad-myspace/&quot;&gt;ya think&lt;/a&gt;?), and anyone who enjoy&amp;#39;s Andrew Keen is not a likely candidate to score very highly on the Web 2.0 hype-o-meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I&amp;#39;m really getting quite a treat out of Web 2.0&amp;#39;s newest starchild, Cre8Buzz.  Real Estate professionals can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8buzz.com/real_estate/signup_now&quot;&gt;join here&lt;/a&gt;.  (I&amp;#39;m not sure whether the general sign-up is open to the public yet or not.  It was &amp;quot;invitation only&amp;quot; when I first visited).   When you come by, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8buzz.com/profiles/1256&quot;&gt;visit me&lt;/a&gt; and say hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an interesting ranking system, &amp;quot;Buzz Rank&amp;quot;, that combines other users voting for you and your own participation.  If you use their widget, the score that&amp;#39;s published is your score within your community category, not your overall score for the site, which is kind of neat.  OK, what can I say -- I was the Lisa Simpson type of kid who liked to bring home &amp;quot;A&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; on my report card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still pretty new, so there&amp;#39;s a good chance the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8buzz.com/profiles/0&quot;&gt;Antman&lt;/a&gt; will come by to say hello to you in person.   Ants with megaphones -- what&amp;#39;s not to love?  Social network -- cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone to date has been pretty hail fellow well met with no special politics brewing yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like -- I mean I really like -- is the fact that people aren&amp;#39;t contacting me to install the newest Facebook application.  Being poked was silly enough, but getting Superpoked with a sheep thrown at you is just TOO IMMATURE.  But  ants with megaphones, on the other hand -- that&amp;#39;s an age appropriate play group for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a customizable profile page &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Myspace, which I like since my alter-ego the real estate broker capitalist can put up the corporate logo and feel good about it.  JavaScript widgets don&amp;#39;t work -- tried that.  Of course, the downside of customization is that you bump into the usual folks who have fairly unreadable pages with background images of light green aliens and foreground text that&amp;#39;s dark green 4 pixel high Old English Script italic or what have you.  People, I know you&amp;#39;re all democratically broadcasting yourself and all, but readability matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only real complaint so far, and I&amp;#39;m sure this&amp;#39;ll get fixed as time goes on, is the interface to the blog, which is primitive in the extreme.  We&amp;#39;re talking you can&amp;#39;t yet code an HREF tag in there.  It finds &amp;quot;http://&amp;quot; and does the right thing with that, but no links of a more sophisticated nature are allowed.  Even some of the most basic formatting just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8buzz.com/profiles/1256/blogs/8297/blog_entries/12092&quot;&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t work&lt;/a&gt;.  But what the heck -- it&amp;#39;s a beta, and it&amp;#39;s a social networking web site, not a pacemaker, so as a programmer I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, just one other thing.  I know the developers are probably too young to know about this movie that was already sixteen years old when I watched it as a kid, but here&amp;#39;s the thing:  ants don&amp;#39;t buzz.  They make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/images/AntSound.mp3&quot;&gt;Them! movie ant noise&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;#39;ve never heard that noise before, you really should go check out  &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-828076470184247942&quot;&gt;Them!&lt;/a&gt;.  Watch the whole movie, or fast forward to about 27 minutes 30 seconds and you&amp;#39;ll not only get to watch Joan Weldon walking around, which is always a treat, but if you let it play about two minutes you&amp;#39;ll get to hear plenty of good ant noises.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Traffic versus Qualified Traffic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/05/real-estate-internet-marketing-in-a-nutshell/&quot;&gt;Real Estate Internet Marketing In a Nutshell&lt;/a&gt;, no doubt you left either feeling a) like you couldn&amp;#39;t believe how utterly basic and maybe even banal the points I made were, (Holy Suffering Self-evident, Batman) or b) hungry for walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine your surprise now when you discover that, as seemingly small and frail as that article was, it was nevertheless pregnant with yet another small and frail article.  And so, following the usual twenty-four hour gestation period of the blog post species, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the two main points from the earlier pregnant article was this:  &amp;quot;Get people who want to buy and sell real estate to find you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice we didn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;Getting people to find you.&amp;quot;  The phrase &amp;quot;who want to buy and sell real estate&amp;quot; is what we mean by qualified traffic.  If a person who doesn&amp;#39;t want to buy or sell real estate visits your site, that&amp;#39;s just traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong.  Traffic all by itself is not a bad thing, especially if your web site is new and you&amp;#39;re just starting to get some.  At an early enough stage having even unqualified traffic will encourage you a lot more than having no traffic.   However, if you&amp;#39;re interested in making money, eventually you need to start getting more &lt;em&gt;qualified&lt;/em&gt; traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is qualified traffic?  Well, think about the whole universe of people poking around on the Internet, fellow bloggers, etc., versus that subgroup of people who just entered &amp;quot;Yourtown Real Estate&amp;quot; into a search engine.  Naturally the latter group is much more qualified to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the best sources of qualified traffic, therefore, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New people reaching you from real estate related searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reached you from real estate related searches in the past, who are returning.  (That&amp;#39;s a whole new subject in itself, getting visitors to come back to your site).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that searches are qualification tools is what makes Internet Marketing such a wonderful investment.   Even pay-per-click is completely efficient compared to mailing, for example.  Consider, would you rather pay $1.00 to mail to one person at random, or $3.00 to get your message in front of one person searching for &amp;quot;Yourtown Real Estate&amp;quot;.  Sure, if you&amp;#39;re doing a mailing, you&amp;#39;d try to narrow down the list, but it&amp;#39;s hard to see it ever getting as good as the list of people who are actively looking for your product &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reductio ad Myspace</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend at the bookstore I browsed through Andrew Keen&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Amateur-Internet-Killing-Culture/dp/0385520808&quot;&gt;Cult of the Amateur&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of interest.  I also looked into a book that&amp;#39;s probably at the opposite end of the Web 2.0 Hype-o-Meter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Wikinomics-Mass-Collaboration-Changes-Everything/dp/1591841380&quot;&gt;Wikinomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keen argues with some justice that with the huge proliferation of blogs, the Internet has become a write-only Darwinian struggle to see who can filibuster the longest, with everyone yapping our heads off and no one really listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikinomics, on the other hand, left me wondering how I, too, could benefit from this whole massive collaboration thing to become blindingly wealthy and massively collaborated, but I couldn&amp;#39;t come up with anything off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As they say on Ron Popeil Commercials:  &amp;quot;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now not only can your blog be one of over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogherald.com/2005/04/14/number-of-blogs-now-exceeds-50-million-worldwide/&quot;&gt;50 million blogs&lt;/a&gt; in the keyboardosphere, now you can be the first on your block to have your own social network, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ning.com&quot;&gt;Ning.com&lt;/a&gt;.  In the words of Ning CEO, Gina Bianchini:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Marc and I founded Ning in October 2004 to give everyone the opportunity to create your own social networks for anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atta girl, Gina.  That&amp;#39;s just what we needed, social networks for anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the true spirit of Web 2.0, I have decided that if I can, of course that means I should, so I am now the proud owner of not just one, but TWO social networks, with me as the one member each!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://particlewave.ning.com/&quot;&gt;Visit &lt;em&gt;Real Estate Internet Marketing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sacramentorealestate.ning.com/xn/detail/u_19ydvgcp6voem&quot;&gt;View my profile on &lt;em&gt;Sacramento Real Estate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/windowslivewriterreductioadmyspace-c3fbimage-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/windowslivewriterreductioadmyspace-c3fbimage-thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That was the whole problem with MySpace, come to think of it -- they let YOU in.  Now we can each have our own MySpace, which for the sake of clarity we can call MyMySpace, to distinguish it from YourMySpace and ThatOtherGuysMySpace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, but seriously, come join me.  We can massively collaborate, at least on a small scale.  Won&amp;#39;t that be cozy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first network I noticed when poking around Ning was the virtual Sangha.  Hey great, I thought, I&amp;#39;m a Buddhist, but it turns out that one&amp;#39;s by invitation only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least I&amp;#39;m not the only anti-social Buddhist with his own social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have *&lt;em&gt;two *&lt;/em&gt;of them.  So there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided to check out the RightHealth Social network.  At the right are some of the forum questions from RightHealth so you can get an idea of the quality of the discourse.  (Click to enlarge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t wait for it to get this bad, it was the first thing I bumped into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I started a Luddite group if Andrew Keen would join me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why You Should Care About What Your Clients Care About</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write another article about how the enthusiastic tail of real estate blogging frequently wags the dog of analyzing and understanding how our web sites attract and convert business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Real Estate Tomato finally provided the impetus when they ran a post yesterday with the title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2007/10/the-7-reasons-w.html&quot;&gt;The 7 Reasons Why Your (Future) Clients Should Care That You Are Real Estate Blogger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to appear like I&amp;#39;m picking on the Tomato or the co-authors of this article, most of whom I don&amp;#39;t know. However, I do think that focusing on what future clients should care about begs a more interesting and potentially profitable question about what _past and present _clients actually _do _care about. To be sure, as they say in the stock market, &amp;quot;past history does not guarantee future results&amp;quot;. On the other hand, if you&amp;#39;re about to embark on an activity that&amp;#39;s going to consume at least an hour or two per day for years on end, it helps to go into that activity with the attitude that you&amp;#39;ll investigate what actually does happen, as opposed to what should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My What-Clients-Should-Care-About Wish List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, I&amp;#39;d love it if my clients cared that I&amp;#39;m a real estate blogger. In fact, it&amp;#39;d be great if they cared that I was a Honda owner and over six feet tall, because that would further narrow the field down to me. If they all wanted guys with brown hair who originally come from Rhode Island and now live in Cameron Park, then hey presto: I&amp;#39;d be a shoe-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What They Should Want versus What They DO Want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, however, that clients have their own ideas about what they care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, are, moreover, a few reasonably good ways to get at what those things are that your client cares about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them, and they may tell you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to them when they volunteer information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics&quot;&gt;web analytics&lt;/a&gt; to find out. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could stand some improvement when it comes to asking my clients what they care about. When I started Elite Properties, I had all sorts of forms and systems in place before I got around to writing my Customer Satisfaction Survey, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By listening to clients, however, I&amp;#39;ve learned that they usually liked a few things about my web sites and my agents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;#39;t make them register before letting them search the MLS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web site is easy to use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We return phone calls and emails quickly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding web analytics gives us more information. To be sure, web analytics is a little bit of a dull-edged tool in some respects. For example, it tells me that about 35% of the people who reach the home page will click right on through to the basic search page, versus only about 11% for the blog. It also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/10/30/whos-reading-your-blog-you-dont-have-one-bounce-rate-you-have-many/&quot;&gt;tells me&lt;/a&gt; that more than 80% of the people who reach me for the term &amp;quot;Sacramento Real Estate&amp;quot; stay on the site, while only one third of the people searching for &amp;quot;Sacramento Real Estate Blog&amp;quot; make a journey further in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, returning again to the listening to clients category, the thing that most makes me a believer in the power of online search tools is the number of people who end up being clients who start a conversation as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, my name is so and so. I found a listing on your web site...[goes on to give MLS number or address].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My agents and I have talked to literally hundreds of people who&amp;#39;ve started conversations like that. In that same time, the number of people who&amp;#39;ve mentioned my blog can be counted on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So What Do Clients Want?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty about my empirical knowledge that clients like to look at houses online is that it fits so well from what I have reasoned about my clients according to Cartesian first principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all remember Descartes: &amp;quot;I think, therefore I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my crack at the real estate version: &amp;quot;I buy and sell real estate, therefore, my clients are interested in real estate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just garden variety true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Why Should I Care About What My Clients Care About?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caring about what I think my clients _should _care about is another way of saying that I care about me -- and they already probably guessed that before they ever happened on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, caring about what my clients &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about helps me to design a site with a clearer path to the goals that &lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt; have for a real estate web site, and it helps me see my writing in light of the things they care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end this is all self-interest, of course, and it&amp;#39;s nothing new. This is classic Zig Ziglar: &amp;quot;You can get anything you want, if you help enough other people get what they want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hang-up is, you have to get other people what they really want. Getting them what you think they should want doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lesson in that for this blog as well, but one could argue that I haven&amp;#39;t learned it yet. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bounce Rates By Keyword</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the many great views on your web site data that Google Analytics provides you with is information about your bounce rate sorted by search engine keyword.  I was intrigued when I looked at this the other day, partly because of Dave Smith&amp;#39;s recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatebloglab.com/real-estate-blogging/take-a-little-bounce-out-of-your-bounce-rate/&quot;&gt;article on bounce rates&lt;/a&gt;, but also because it fit into my recent article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/10/25/real-estate-blogging-platforms-compared-part-3/&quot;&gt;integrated blogs and web sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/windowslivewriteryoudonthaveonebouncerateyouhavemany-8f72image-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve pasted some data from Google Analytics for my Sacramento real estate site here (with a few fields omitted for the sake of clarity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the numbers, I was struck first of all by the good news that I had a really low comparative bounce rate exactly where I want it -- for the key word &amp;quot;Sacramento Real Estate&amp;quot;.  My bounce rate there is a meager 18.66%, meaning that more than 80% of the people who reach me for that keyword go further into my site.  Moreover, I know from another site analysis tool I use that about 35% are clicking straight through to my basic search page (with still others clicking through to other search options).  Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; side, my highest bounce rate is for another phrase that brings a lot of people to my site, &amp;quot;things to do in Sacramento&amp;quot;.  (When I first started the site I had a separate blog about Sacramento Things to Do as a &amp;quot;fluff piece&amp;quot;.  I still get lots of traffic for it.)  For that keyword, about 3/4 of the people who reach the site end up searching elsewhere, which is not surprising given that that&amp;#39;s not what my site is really about.  This is not something that needs to be fixed, unless I start selling theater tickets instead of houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One statistic that was not surprising to me is the bounce rate for the phrase &amp;quot;Sacramento Real Estate Blog&amp;quot;, which is 66.7%.  This that may come as a shock to other bloggers who are steeped in the conventional wisdom that buyers are blog readers looking for an expert.  Two thirds of the people looking for the blog go no further into the site, while more than four fifths of the people who are looking for real estate do go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Point of All This, And I Do Have One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web site analytics tools like Google Analytics (by the way, did someone say &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt;?) can provide you with valuable insights into what your visitors are actually doing when they reach your web site.  What pages do they visit?  Where do they go next?  What keywords are getting you buyers?  How many visitors are returning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the results are not what you&amp;#39;d expect -- and when they&amp;#39;re not, this can be the best information of all.  For example, in the numbers at right, I noticed that my bounce rate for Sacramento Condos is 32.08%, but my bounce rate for Sacramento Foreclosures is 62.5%.  Yet those pages are almost identical.  Perhaps I need to go see how to improve the foreclosure page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or take the matter of the low conversion rate for the blog.  Are there ways to improve that?  Of course there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel a definite &amp;quot;follow-on article&amp;quot; feeling coming on.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Five Favorite Wordpress Plugins</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the (many) great things about the Wordpress blogging platform is the huge number of enthusiastic supporters who write third party plugins.  Very often, if Wordpress doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do what you want yet, you can find a Plugin that will modify its behavior so that it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With plugins, you can turn Wordpress from an already great open source blogging platform into a fairly complete content management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugins I&amp;#39;ve downloaded have usually worked quite well &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot;, though from time to time I&amp;#39;ve done some &amp;quot;minor&amp;quot; tweaks -- minor, that is, from a programmer&amp;#39;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here then are my candidates for the Top Five Wordpress Plugins.  Naturally your list will depend on what *&lt;em&gt;you *&lt;/em&gt;want your Wordpress installation to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Spam Karma 2
*&lt;/em&gt;Top Five?  Forget it -- this is the one!  As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, No Wordpress installation can be considered complete until Dr. Dave&amp;#39;s outstanding &lt;a href=&quot;http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/&quot;&gt;Spam Karma 2&lt;/a&gt; is installed and activated.  Spam Karma 2 deserves its description as the &amp;quot;ultimate spam killer&amp;quot;.  If you&amp;#39;re suffering from Wordpress comment spam, Wordpress now ships with Askimet, which seemed to work ok when I last tried it, but it always struck me that Spam Karma 2 caught more spam than Askimet.  Moreover, Spam Karma 2 itself has its own plugin system, allowing people to modify and extend how it behaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Spam Karma 2 Moderate
*&lt;/em&gt;OK, this is not technically a Wordpress plugin, it&amp;#39;s a Spam Karma 2 Plugin (which makes it a Wordpress Plugin Plugin -- yikes!).  The point of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-moderate-plugin/&quot;&gt;moderate plugin&lt;/a&gt; is that Spam Karma 2 -- perhaps being the &amp;quot;ultimate spam killer&amp;quot; and all -- thinks that you&amp;#39;d never need to moderate your posts, presumably since it got all the spam.  The moderate plugin fixes this by capturing the obvious Spam and then still letting you moderate your posts.  This can be helpful, for example, if you&amp;#39;re getting a lot of people stopping by for the sake of arguing with you, which can happen from time to time.  (See the CollegeHumor parody on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1771556&quot;&gt;Blog Commenters&lt;/a&gt;).  As a special bonus, if you scroll down on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-moderate-plugin/&quot;&gt;moderate plugin&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;#39;ll see that I sent it&amp;#39;s author, Peter Westwood, a fix for a minor issue I discovered with the plugin.  This proves that even real estate brokers can make good contributions to Open Source projects if they used to be programmers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Page Links To
*&lt;/em&gt;One of the neat things about Wordpress is that you can use it not just to blog, but to manage web site pages that are not chronological.  In other words, you can use Wordpress as a full-fledged content management system -- which is a fancy way of saying it&amp;#39;s an easy tool for creating or changing the pages on your web site.  Many Wordpress themes support adding pages, so when you add a page to Wordpress, you automatically get a link to that page added on your menu.  But what about the case where there&amp;#39;s already a page somewhere that you want to link to.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s part of your IDX system, for example your MLS listing search page that&amp;#39;s maintained by another company.  Now what?  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/page-links-to/comment-page-4/&quot;&gt;Page Links To Plugin&lt;/a&gt; let&amp;#39;s you add some code to a sort of &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; page, which in turn tells the navigation system to link not to the page, but to whatever web address you tell it that the (ta da!) &amp;quot;page links to&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Page Category Plus
*&lt;/em&gt;I recently discovered Yellow Swordfish&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/page-category-plus/&quot;&gt;Page Category Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and installed it immediately because it struck me that by using it I could set up the page navigation at the left.  Page Category Plus lets your pages have categories just like your posts do, so that using it, you can set up left hand navigation for all your pages.  Being a programmer, this was not a big deal for me personally, since the old non-Wordpress way of tweaking the navigation bar (put it in a file and then just re-edit the file and FTP it up to the site) has always worked for me.  What Page Category Plus allows me to do is create the very same look as I could achieve manually but have it all be part of the Wordpress page system.  This means that custom web site clients could update their own pages themselves if they wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Better Feed
*&lt;/em&gt;PlanetOzh&amp;#39;s plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-better-feed-rss/&quot;&gt;BetterFeed&lt;/a&gt;, allows you to automatically make some neat changes to your RSS feed.  Why would you care about what&amp;#39;s in your RSS feed?  Well, for one reason, your RSS feed is what your subscribers see.   So let&amp;#39;s say want to offer someone an incentive for subscribing, an idea I&amp;#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events/subscribe.php&quot;&gt;testing out&lt;/a&gt; on my Sacramento Blog.  I&amp;#39;m using PlanetOzh&amp;#39;s plugin to add some links to the Subscriber-only content directly into my feed.  (Please note that you don&amp;#39;t want to add anything really secret this way, since chances are pretty good your feed is available to non-subscribers as well -- that&amp;#39;s how people turn into subscribers is by accessing your feed.  But in the case of discount coupons and the like, if someone thinks they found a &amp;quot;forbidden freebie&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting Back in the Groove</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, it&amp;#39;s hard to believe it, but it&amp;#39;s been over a year since my last Internet Marketing Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the way to run a successful blog.  I consider myself duly chastised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting to me to note how October comes, and when October comes all the Realtors® start slowing down and writing e-book projects.  Last year I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2006/10/05/the-ebook-project/&quot;&gt;threatened one&lt;/a&gt;, but fortunately for Western Civilization the threat was a hollow one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com/2007/09/call-for-submissions.html&quot;&gt;Purva is working on one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to last year&amp;#39;s e-book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened to last year&amp;#39;s e-book was that things actually got busy again after October.  In November and December, things had started to take off.  Then by about February, I&amp;#39;d pretty much forgotten that I was supposed to be growing a &amp;quot;new business&amp;quot; doing Internet marketing services for Realtors®.  I put &amp;quot;new business&amp;quot; in scare quotes because this is really my current business as well, it&amp;#39;s just that in my current business, I do it for one customer, my own brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How well that&amp;#39;s going is that I&amp;#39;ve been fortunate to enjoy #1 search results for some pretty important keyword combinations on major search engines.  Not just first page results, but top of the first page results.  I like those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary, but to my way of thinking there&amp;#39;s just no reason to even get started on an Internet marketing campaign if you can&amp;#39;t dominate a niche.  That&amp;#39;s where you should be heading.  Your site should be generating leads for you.  If it&amp;#39;s not, fix it or fire it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is IDX?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;IDX stands for &amp;quot;Internet Data Exchange&amp;quot;, and is also called Broker Reciprocity.  Simply put, it is a technology that enables individual real estate agents and brokers to host listing data on their web sites, and to receive the leads generated when users inquire about listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDX has been around for several years.  The idea is that brokers and agents should enable other MLS participants to display aggregated listing information on their web sites. Indeed, the National Association or Realtors Policy Statement says that brokers must make this information available to other members of their MLS, unless the broker explicitly opts out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written in the NAR policy statement (please check with Realtor.org for the latest version), &amp;quot;Associations of REALTORS and their Multiple Listing Services are encouraged to immediately, and must by January 1, 2002, enable MLS Participants to display on Participants&amp;#39; public website aggregated MLS active listing information through, at Participants&amp;#39; option, either downloading and placing the data on Participants&amp;#39; public access web site or by framing such information on the MLS or Association public access web site (if such a site is available) subject to the requirements of state law and regulation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, that means that NAR recognizes that the informed consumer wants to see listing data when they go to a Realtor&amp;#39;s web site, and they want to make this information available to all Realtors to publish on their web sites -- even those agents who work with buyers exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Farewell, Search Engine Optimization, We Hardly Knew Ye</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Toprank blog had a short but intriguing essay recently discussing predictions about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://toprank.blogspot.com/2006/09/seo-dies-slow-death.html&quot;&gt;Death of SEO&lt;/a&gt; within the next five years or so.  To me, this is one of those articles that is important not because of the answers it provides but because of the questions it raises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I do agree with the author that Search Engine Optimization is getting harder and harder to do.  I say this with some confidence because, over time, I&amp;#39;ve found that the effort that I need to expend to promote a site to top place has grown over time from something I would consider child&amp;#39;s play to a sort of full time Herculean task that may or may not produce results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, indeed, to the extent it becomes more difficult, I&amp;#39;m sure that over time SEO failure stories will become more prevalent than the success stories, and that won&amp;#39;t be good for SEO as an enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit, however, that the author loses me later on in the article when he talks about building traffic through social media becoming more effective.  Although in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://toprank.blogspot.com/2006/09/5-website-traffic-alternatives-to.html&quot;&gt;later article&lt;/a&gt; the author does go on to give specifics as to how this might work, I do feel like there&amp;#39;s a little bit of the ubiquitous &amp;quot;If you blog it they will come&amp;quot; hocus pocus going on.  To me, there&amp;#39;s nothing more effective than the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User is looking for a solution to a problem, and types a search in a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User finds results that match what she&amp;#39;s looking for, and clicks through to a web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web site looks like a fit for what she&amp;#39;s trying to do, and offers more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phone rings.  Start selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably cases where one can sell effectively through the social network of fellow bloggers, but it all depends on what you&amp;#39;re selling, I think.  In the case of real estate blogging services, the people reading your blog are also your likely buyers.  My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestatetomato.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Jim Cronin&lt;/a&gt; is doing a brisk business capitalizing on this.  But in the case of real estate blogs, on the other hand, I&amp;#39;ve found that most of my readers are either fellow Realtors® or folks who want to take pot shots at us.  So there&amp;#39;s no direct correlation between blogging and business -- the &amp;quot;social network&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m targetting here starts with a &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; and rhymes with frugal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve found, however, is that this is only working for me on sites with a long history already, so for me, &amp;quot;search engines versus social networks&amp;quot; not is not a case of either/or, it&amp;#39;s a case of one of those hands washing the other.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Lazy Boy Buddhism Revisited</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost time to sit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight is Tuesday, the night of my Sangha meeting, which I skipped this evening.  Last week during the sit I felt a great deal of tension, which I think comes from the wrong seat -- a rather uncomfortable plastic chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about floor Buddhists:  at least they know what they&amp;#39;re sitting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week there was knowing about that, and darn it, just getting busy feeding some silly video game.  So I get to write about it, which isn&amp;#39;t doing too much for me as you can plainly see, and then I get to sit on my lazy boy, which lately has been quite wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My meditation sessions since Tuesday have been some of the best ever, very deep, relaxed, insightful -- almost as though I can feel my brain being reprogrammed.  Yes, indeed that is a materialistic way to put it.  One little exercise that I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying is shining the white metta light on whatever disturbances or ill feelings arise.  Tonight however I feel like I should nap before the sit a while -- there&amp;#39;s not much brain left at the end of the wick.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Real Estate Web Site EBook Project</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I am beginning work on an eBook project entitled &amp;quot;What Every Realtor® Should Know Before Buying a Web Site&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics this eBook will explore will include custom sites versus template sites, IDX, search engine optimization, pay per click advertising, blogging, landing pages, reciprocal linking, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I&amp;#39;m planning on reviewing the web sites that are available from several major web site vendors so that potential buyers will have an informed basis for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may also discuss alternatives to developing a web site.  Let&amp;#39;s face it, not everyone in the business cares about HTML and blogging and the like, but many agents still want to get leads from the Internet.  This pent up desire for business is feeding a thriving lead re-sale industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks, I&amp;#39;ll set up a mailing list for those who might be interested in learning more about the eBook as I develop it, and I will probably use content that I send to the mailing list members as the basis for what will become the eBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there&amp;#39;s a lot to learn and put together to get this done, and I welcome input from Realtors® about their experiences with different web site companies and lead providers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to ParticleWave&#39;s Internet Marketing Blog</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Lockwood here.  I&amp;#39;ve been saying for some time now that I need to get some more focus to this web site, and now it&amp;#39;s finally kicking off with the launch of my real estate Internet marketing blog.  The purpose of this blog will be to serve as a major resource for information about making money on the Internet, with a special focus on how Real Estate professionals can use all the tools that technology has to offer to improve their business.  We&amp;#39;ll have a new interface in a day or so, and start moving content over from our personal blog, then we&amp;#39;ll start adding what we hope you&amp;#39;ll find are lots of great new articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pull up an RSS reader and stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Schizoprhrainia of the Brainia</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a cartoon once in which a character was accused by some mad doctor type of having &amp;quot;Schizophrenia of the Brainia&amp;quot; -- I put up a variant spelling above so you can see how to pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably it was a Flintstones episode.  I was glued to those as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the spirit of schizophrenia of the brainia that I reflect today on my web site and blog here.  On the one hand I have a personal blog that&amp;#39;s kind of fun, about Buddhism and Depression and what-note that I feel like what-noting.  On the other hand, I really want to use this prime &amp;quot;internet marketing real estate&amp;quot; to talk about (and sell) &amp;quot;internet real estate marketing&amp;quot; as a service.  Pardon the clever use of dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But schizophrenia / multiple personality disorder isn&amp;#39;t really the metaphor I&amp;#39;m going for.  The goal of a doctor treating a patient with multiple personality disorder is to get them to become re-integrated.  But the goal of doctor me in treating this multiple personality web site, unless I miss my guess, should be to disintegrate it into two separate blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to Writing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I add a new category: writing.   Hello, new category.  It&amp;#39;s so easy to smile at such a friendly and welcome new visitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first post in this friendly new category is also a bit of homework for a new book, &amp;quot;The Freelance Writer&amp;#39;s Bible&amp;quot;.  The point of the exercise was to go write something, as an illustration of how simple it is to get over writer&amp;#39;s block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure I have writer&amp;#39;s block, per se.  I write all the time.  What I do wish to remove, however, are my remaining getting-paid-for-it blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might say that insofar as my real estate business is based on my successful web sites, and inasmuch as my web sites are successful because I write, that I&amp;#39;m also already a professional writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a joy, then, this weekend, to discover that there&amp;#39;s actually a business to be made of the activity of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my high school yearbook, I wrote down that my dream was to have one wife, one son, one dog, and one published novel.  As it turns out, I am fortunate to have a lovely wife, a wonderful daughter, two four-legged dogs, and no published novels.   Even to this day, having a novel seems a bit out there, something uncomprehended, a vague possiblity.   But it&amp;#39;s less of a stretch for my impoverished imagination to get from a place where I blindly chase for search engine love with a mixed bag of sites both successful and fairly well free, to a place where I work on a business of writing for pay.  This journey strikes me as altogether entertaining and worthy of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So best of luck to you, new category.  I sense the spark of greatness in you already, your potential to become the fulfillment of the goal I set recently, for this web site to be about something.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form, and Some Good Podcasts</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebuddhistblog.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Buddhist Blog&lt;/a&gt;, we learn about some excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpcast.org/&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; from the Deer Park Monastery.  While listening to one of these, the Heart Sutra was sung beautifully, leading me to look a little further into the idea of emptiness is form, and form is emptiness.  Google was good enough to lead me to this excellent article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html&quot;&gt;Emptiness is Form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Buddhism Without Beliefs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a book I want to look into soon.  I&amp;#39;ve seen it around for some time, waiting for me to read it.  The other night a member of my meditation group mentioned this book to someone who was a Buddhist but not ready to accept certain ideas on faith, like rebirth.  He might just as well have been talking to me, since I&amp;#39;m not ready either.  Actually I sense a little bit of a difference, inasmuch as I find I don&amp;#39;t care too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some great material in the Pali Canon that has a bearing on this issue, and is quoted in chapter 3 of Bhikku Bodhi&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;In The Buddha&amp;#39;s Words&amp;quot; -- which is a book which waited a very short time indeed for me to read it.  This is a wonderful book, that makes me want to stuff the whole Pali Canon into my head.  Where&amp;#39;s my shoe horn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe one can see Bikkhu Bodhi is wrestling with some of Batchelor&amp;#39;s concerns in some of his own prefaces to the Pali Canon material.  But you don&amp;#39;t have to buy the book to see him grapple with it head on, since you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha106.htm&quot;&gt;Bodhi&amp;#39;s review of Batchelor&amp;#39;s book&lt;/a&gt;.   Since my last philosophical destination prior to Buddhism was atheism, I am very sympathetic to what I know about Batchelor&amp;#39;s position while at the same time being fairly untroubled about the whole issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think some times those of us who are agnostic or atheistic in our beliefs fight a primarily social battle, in which we long to be accepted by our fellows, who may have some elements of a lifestyle we wish to pursue, but who have no compunctions about faithful leaps they&amp;#39;re supposed to be making in their tradition.  I&amp;#39;m sympathetic to Batchelor, but I think at the same time I&amp;#39;d already fought this fight so well in another context that I don&amp;#39;t see much need for it in Buddhism.  It helps to be a newcomer in some respects.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What’s Up This Week</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;#39;s become evident this week is that, with my efforts to re-establish a career veering off in many different directions like some series of poorly made bottle rockets, there&amp;#39;s barely a smidgeon of rice paper or the like between charming motivated John and going back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inasmuch as I&amp;#39;m not in bed but here being at least charming if not motivated, I am, ipso fatso, Fatso.   But I&amp;#39;d rather be that than that idiot, Ipso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime, my categories checkboxes tell me that this post is also designed to be about Buddhism somehow, so it&amp;#39;s time for the weekly Sangha update, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the meditation groups I&amp;#39;ve been attending has turned out to be somewhat untenable.  It takes a while to find one&amp;#39;s way around, I suspect.  The other group, which met last night again, was once again very tasty.  Next week we&amp;#39;ll be sitting in a new hall instead of one of the member&amp;#39;s homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find I prosper in such meetings to the extent they&amp;#39;re more like a group of meditators getting together, and less like a church.  It&amp;#39;s nice that someone has robes and prostrates to the altar a multiple of three times and has other traditions -- it&amp;#39;s just not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Notes I Sangha This Week</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This was a good week in my Buddhist devleopment, inasmuch as I went out and met many more live two legged Buddhists than I have in the last year or more.  On Monday I was fortunate to drive somewhat quickly and arrive in time for the Dharma Practice and Teachings session at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lionsroarmandala.org&quot;&gt;Lions Roar Dharma Center&lt;/a&gt;.  This Sangha was very friendly and welcoming and I enjoyed my visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I had a wonderful time sitting with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtstream.org/sittinggroups.html&quot;&gt;sitting group in Placerville&lt;/a&gt;.  Chris Basiletti led a great Dharma talk after the meditation period, and there was a fun discussion afterwards that I enjoyed very much.  As if that weren&amp;#39;t enough, we then took a break for tea, and our host provided some tea for us that seemed a lot like unconditioned tea to me.  OK, that&amp;#39;s an exaggeration, I&amp;#39;m sure, but it was very good tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I didn&amp;#39;t get to play with any Buddhist pals, because I was holding a house open with my good friend who is a Catholic loan officer, and only one inquisitive neighbor stopped by.  Now this doesn&amp;#39;t sound entertaining, but it really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday and Friday were days with a Y in them, too.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Concentration First, Then Mindfulness, Then Adsense</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a goal for this web site.  It&amp;#39;s an important goal, but I&amp;#39;m very much in the beginning phases of implementing it.  The goal for this web site is to be about something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not too much to ask, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be this site was about software, and it was a good place to try out new web development techniques.  So I&amp;#39;d rewrite it endlessly.  In the same way, neolithic web developers would use the same wall on the same cave in France, and whenever they wanted to paint a new buffalo they&amp;#39;d just paint over the old buffalo.  That&amp;#39;s why if you actually start clicking around here you&amp;#39;ll find the remnants of past mental civilizations, old articles on Assembly Language, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffalos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the site might be described charitably as an eclectic brew of intellectual musings, or uncharitably as drive by victim of its author&amp;#39;s mid life crisis.  But I don&amp;#39;t want to leave it at that.  I want this site to be about something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I hate to give up this site&amp;#39;s modest but established traffic.  There are links here, and page rank.  It&amp;#39;s the postunmodern equivalent of having one paleolithic dummy saying to one another, &amp;quot;Hey Og, I know where there&amp;#39;s a bunch of pictures of buffaloes.  Want to see it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we all know, Og famously replied:  &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s a picture?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if the artist, Og Monet as it were, gets tired of painting buffaloes?  Then you&amp;#39;ve got this neatly trampled dirt leading to the buffalo gallery, and some dispirited former artist scribbling to-do lists where the deer and the antelope played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m waiting for this site to be about something, I&amp;#39;ll link to some more Buddhist pals, and maybe it&amp;#39;ll end up being about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s more earnestly about something, you&amp;#39;ll be the first to know.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Depression is a Choice</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I began looking at A. B. Curtiss&amp;#39; book, &amp;quot;Depression is a Choice&amp;quot;, which you can also get a feel for from Curtiss&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.depressionisachoice.com&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only sampled the first few pages to date, but the writing style is clear and direct, and the ideas compelling.  Needless to say, the thesis is a bit of a controversial one, and given that I&amp;#39;m just getting into it and therefore not intending to review it just yet, let me just link to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?id=779&amp;amp;type=book&amp;amp;cn=5&quot;&gt;more competent review&lt;/a&gt; and counterpoint by Curtiss herself.  Actually I think that reviewer, though more thorough than me, is less probably less sympathetic than I would tend to be, but read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My synopsis of Curtiss&amp;#39; argument  is that people can think whatever they want to, and by directing one&amp;#39;s thinking away from depression, one can short-circuit its otherwise intractable hold on one&amp;#39;s mood.  This works because the mind can only focus on one object at a time.  This certainly explains the strong effect I noticed when setting some goals, not only working concretely with the neocortex, but working concretely with the neocortex on something that is the opposite of the whole cognitive enterprise of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where depression denies choice over one&amp;#39;s reality, goal setting is an activity that -- if anything -- overstates one&amp;#39;s choice over one&amp;#39;s reality.  One of the important caveats that the author of Mindtools&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindtools.com/page6.html&quot;&gt;Personal Goal Setting&lt;/a&gt; article gives us is not to focus on goals that are directly attainable and subject to our own choice (within certain preconditions like not dying today and the like, presumably):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set performance goals, not outcome goals: You should take care to set goals over which you have as much control as possible. There is nothing more dispiriting than failing to achieve a personal goal for reasons beyond your control. These could be bad business environments, poor judging, bad weather, injury, or just plain bad luck. If you base your goals on personal performance, then you can keep control over the achievement of your goals and draw satisfaction from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice to direct the mind away from depression is an action, albeit one on a mental level.  Goal setting takes place with pen and paper, or software, so it is actively directing one away from a focus on depression.  However, I do think that an important component of the whole process is making achievable and therefore reinforcing progress on small goals.  There we have more action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David D. Burns, M.D., in &amp;quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&amp;quot; (see above -- this material is circa page 170 in my edition) discusses motivation and action in terms of a virtuous cycle.  You don&amp;#39;t get motivated by willing motivation, you get motivated by some small action.  The action then gives you motivation, and then you can take more action, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Depression, Motivation, and the Real Me</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently set as a goal for myself to learn all I can about depression and motivation.  This is because I found that as I actively began to examine my life and create goals for each area (i.e., take control of my destiny), I found this process very enjoyable and anti-depressing in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffer from what (I believe) is mild depression.  So no need to send the marines out or anything -- I&amp;#39;m not going to cut my wrists with a sharp debugger or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of my first forays onto the internet brought this to light:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most insidious aspects of depression is that there is a tendency to attribute the symptoms to other factors in our lives. A lack of enjoyment, motivation or increased irritability at home may be considered to be due to a (possibly non-existent) problem with personal relationships. Similarly we may start to consider changing jobs believing that it is the external environment that is responsible when in fact it is a treatable illness affecting our interpretation of the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What often happens is that in looking to our environment to find the reasons for what are symptoms of an illness, we try to &amp;#39;fix&amp;#39; things that are not broken which can have a very real destructive impact on our lives. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis and getting the most effective treatment for you, will make an enormous difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.depressionet.com.au/sod/types.html&quot;&gt;Types of Depression&lt;/a&gt; page over at DepressionNet.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, bulls-eye.  Isn&amp;#39;t that the story of my career over the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then what can I say at this point about motivation and depression?  Not much, I&amp;#39;m just at the beginning of my inquiry, but I do know that I seem to feel best when creating my own life rather than suffering from it.  Yet it&amp;#39;s the same set of external circumstances either way.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Quote of the Day</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been my policy to view the Internet not as an &amp;#39;information highway,&amp;#39; but as an electronic asylum filled with babbling loonies.&amp;quot; -Mike Royko, as quoted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chem1.com/chemed/flimflam.html&quot;&gt;Instructional Resources for Chemistry Educators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re reading this, whether you consider yourself Napoleon or Jesus, I welcome you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you&amp;#39;re not really either.  I know everything, because I&amp;#39;m god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m not.  Had you going there for a minute, didn&amp;#39;t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, bad jokes or not, sometimes I really do feel like this asylum atomosphere has a depressive influence.  I think that the ethernet packets are leaking, and some unhealthy miasms are getting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid miasms.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>IDXBroker Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was working on the business plan for John Lockwood Associates, and thinking through how I would set up my IDX Broker site.  I&amp;#39;ve used IHomefinder for years for real estate agent sites and like them a lot, but I didn&amp;#39;t think their broker sites would do what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I put a call in to the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idxbroker.com&quot;&gt;IDXBroker.com&lt;/a&gt; and spoke to Chad, and Chad explained what his company does, which is some excellent integration work and design around IHomefinder sites -- the sort of thing ParticleWave would be doing if we were in that business, more than likely.  But what stood out from the conversation was how helpful Chad was and how much he enjoyed talking to folks about this technology.  In my case, he even turned me back on to IHomefinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Chad&amp;#39;s one of those great guys who puts his client&amp;#39;s needs first, so I wanted to just put up that quick link above and let people know.  If you&amp;#39;re a real estate agent or broker in need of an IDX web site, you owe it to yourself to give Chad a call and see what he can do for you!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Power of Intention</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was reading this fellow, Steve Pavlina, who&amp;#39;s of interest to me because he claims to make great money off Google Adsense.   I&amp;#39;m happy for him in a general way, but I do like to see folks following ideas that make sense to me, and a lot of new age stuff just doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I happened across of Steve&amp;#39;s was his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevepavlina.com/million-dollar-experiment.htm&quot;&gt;Million Dollar Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, which is an expriement in the Voodoo-like power of intention.  This is something that Napoleon Hill would have understood quite well.  Napoeleon Hill, you&amp;#39;ll recall, is the author of &amp;quot;Think and Grow Rich&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a fairly consistent formula for success:  tell people that acquiring wealth is easy, and they will pay you handsomely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the idea behind intention is, you make a decision with full faith and confidence, and this somehow causes the wonderful thing you decided on to happen in your life:  in this case, a million bucks.   As Napoleon Hill put it more concisely:  &amp;quot;Think and grow rich.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at the results of Steve&amp;#39;s experiement. As of today Steve boasts the proud headline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Manifested = $1,780,008.97&lt;br&gt;
2725 Public Participants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, $1.7 million, pretty impressive, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to know is:  OK, how successful have these 2725 public participants been in attracting a million bucks into their lives?  Let&amp;#39;s try some fourth grade math to see if we can solve this awesome intellectual riddle of our day:  dividing, we learn that each participant has made$653.21 so far.  Wow, that&amp;#39;s pretty good.  Most people wouldn&amp;#39;t mind if you handed them a check for that amount.  Of course, for a some professionals that&amp;#39;s a days work or less, and even if you&amp;#39;re unlucky enough to be working minimum wage, you should be able to make that much in about three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s see how that stacks up to the intention people had, which was to have a million dollars.  Again with the fourth grade math:  653.21 / 1,000,000 equals .00065321.  OK, maybe we need to get to seventh or ninth grade in our mathematics to know that we have to shift the decimal point two places to express that as a percentage, but let&amp;#39;s do that to see how successful people have been with this program, where 100% successful means everyone got a million bucks, and 0% successful means everyone got nothing.  OK, the answer is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Pavlina&amp;#39;s program for attracting wealth into your life is &lt;strong&gt;0.065321%&lt;/strong&gt; successful.  Isn&amp;#39;t that amazing?  Be sure to contribute something to his web site.  If you should happen to find yourself unlucky enough in life to trip and fall from a high place, you might try intending to fly.  But I hope you&amp;#39;ll just watch your step.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Buddhism and Rationality</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was thinking about The Words of My Perfect Teacher, the Patrul Rinpoche book I&amp;#39;ve been reading.  It&amp;#39;s such a fun book, so attractive and bright.  Yet at the same time, it&amp;#39;s one of the most &amp;quot;relgious&amp;quot; Buddhist books I&amp;#39;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, Buddhism is a religion.  (Duh).  But I come to it from an ex-Catholic, and (most recently) an atheist background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I say that Patrul Rinpoche&amp;#39;s book is religious, yes, I suppose that is a criticism.  There&amp;#39;s hellfire and brimstone there.   Indeed, there are some of the best hellfire and brimstone descriptions that one is likely to read outside of perhaps Dante.  And there&amp;#39;s plenty of emphasis on obedience and faith.  Yet the book doesn&amp;#39;t put me off much.  The whole religion doesn&amp;#39;t put me off much, which is a fine thing for an (ex?-) atheist to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Buddhism is a much better religiion for an atheist than some of the others that are kicking around, because its practical emphasis on the effects of karmic action doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily need multiple lifetimes to make sense.  Buddhism stresses the natural wish of all beings to be happy, and the natural good effects that flow from compassion, kindness, and other forms of &amp;quot;right action&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the same good and evil problem crops up as elsewhere, and at that point you need some sleight of hand to explain how an evil guy can become rich, for example, or how a good person can lose a child: and by sleight of hand read &amp;quot;multiple lifetimes.&amp;quot;  But if you take Buddhism and cut away the parts an atheist wouldn&amp;#39;t like, you&amp;#39;re still left with some tasty bits: an entire secular recipe for happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internets 2.0</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pleased to report that ParticleWave today became fully Internets 2.0 compliant.  Flickr has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/fynes/89305841/in/pool-webtard/&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this would also be a good time to do my post-mortem on my first three-week iteration of LeadReply, which you might call iterations 1.0, given our naming convention.  Actually in looking over the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), it looks as though iteration 1.0 is not quite mortem yet, since there&amp;#39;s one feature missing -- Realtor® notification.   That should probably be what I tackle today and tomorrow, even though by rights it&amp;#39;s OK since Eudora&amp;#39;s handling it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing is that in iteration one, we combined an autoresponder with an automatic data entry system into a system that can grow into a full fledged contact manager or drip marketing system.  The SQL Server database design is pretty complete -- what gets tricky now is that we&amp;#39;re actually entering clients and leads into production, so modifications to the schema become a bit more involved from here on out.  Fortunately most of the changes we need now are additional stored procedures, so dropping all / creating all should still work fine in that realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iteration one was a good brush up / learning vehicle for more SQL and SQL Server stored procedures than we&amp;#39;d done in many a month, so from the project portfolio aspect it was a good success.  I also got to bang out some good ADO.NET code in C Sharp -- not rocket science, to be sure, but some HR guy is bound to expect that it is, so now I can say, &amp;quot;sure, I&amp;#39;ve done that&amp;quot;, since he&amp;#39;ll never be able to figure out that I could based on how similar it is to everything else in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be worth getting with IHomefinder or Moineau Designs or the like at this point to see if there&amp;#39;s any demand for an IDX lead parser and autoresponder, since that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got at the end of iteration 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I think being where I am at this stage is pretty good given some of the distractions that came up this week such as some existing web site work and a bit of direct client work as well.  The web site, LeadReply.com, is almost utterly nowhere yet -- but that&amp;#39;s exactly where it&amp;#39;s supposed to be at this point, with most of the work on the lead parser and database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built into the SRS was that each iteration should have a go / no go decision about the next iteration.  I&amp;#39;m leaning toward &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; at the moment but will formalize that into the SRS.  If we go ahead, some priorities are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write and test the campaign scheduler for sending out emails after the first &amp;quot;one-off&amp;quot; welcome email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a parameterizable opt-in form that can be included on third party sites (e.g. MY third Internets 2.0 enabled third party sites ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write the corresponding one-click opt-out form, where the default result is &amp;quot;opted out&amp;quot;, but in case the user made a mistake, let them opt back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a bit different focus than the first version of the SRS, so I should get this merged into that and do a bit more planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, what should the business be doing is the harder question than what should the software be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making Money on the Internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I hinted that ParticleWave has been about making money on the Internet all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Gavin DeGraw summed it up, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to be anything other than what I&amp;#39;ve been trying to be lately.&amp;quot;  And I might add, whatever that is, the mind has a propensity to declare that that&amp;#39;s been what it&amp;#39;s been all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime over on my Oakland Blog, I hit the zone this morning with a post about how much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oakland-homes-for-sale.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/24/the-enterprise-of-blogging/&quot;&gt;I love Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.  You might also call that post, &amp;quot;Confessions of an Interloper&amp;quot; -- but if you do that, you waste a perfectly good title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know us interlopers:  We always wonder about what&amp;#39;s in the title tag.  That&amp;#39;s how you get to be an interloper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you make money on the Internet?  It&amp;#39;s  simple, get yourself a domain, like ParticleWave, and then fool around with it in every moment of your spare time for a couple of years until you know something.  Then go off in a totally different direction, i.e., real estate, and have a head-slapping moment when you realize that some other guy in the office is being paid to be an internet interloper.  (Or internetloper, as one might say).  Then realize, &amp;quot;Hey, you can make money on the Internets in Real Estate?  Sweet!  I&amp;#39;ll try that approach.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can stumble into some other way to do.  If you do, that&amp;#39;s great.  I hope I do, to.  Actually, I don&amp;#39;t plan to stumble.  I plan to learn, and to teach, and to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not.  What else have I got going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say this, though.  When I see some other articles about how easy and overnight it is, however, I want to cringe.  For me, it&amp;#39;s been hundreds of hours of work, lots of false starts, hits and misses.  Even now, I can&amp;#39;t say that my Internet revenue is such a big deal that I can afford to give up my &amp;quot;brick and mortar&amp;quot; activities.  Not that I really use brick and mortar on anything, but that&amp;#39;s the idiom.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Categorize This</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Looking in Wordpress on the self-imposed categories I can choose from, &amp;quot;Random Particles&amp;quot; makes perfect sense for this one.   If I&amp;#39;ve understood what this post is about by the end of it, I&amp;#39;ll be happy, since at present I certainly don&amp;#39;t.  It&amp;#39;s an attempt to pull some cohesiveness from multiple disparate mental threads, an imposition of some sort of order into what is essentially cohesive and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand it&amp;#39;s about software battles.  My LeadReply project is going well, suffering only from distractions like the one that prompted this post.  But the spec that&amp;#39;s a scant three weeks old and it&amp;#39;s emphasis on providing the market some sort of .NET demonstration is already feeling outdated, like John Lockwood 1.0.  But that&amp;#39;s the platform, after all, and if Ruby on Rails is as cool as touted, I can always take whatever year I put into LeadReply and redo it in a month if that&amp;#39;s what I feel like doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in part it&amp;#39;s about the distractions from this project.  I&amp;#39;m doing some major reworking of my Oakland site -- and probably will do so here as well, to get it ready to &amp;quot;monetize&amp;quot; it.  What a concept.  One major ParticleWave thread from the beginning has been learning about making money on the Internet.  Now that I&amp;#39;ve finally actually done that through some successful real estate sites, I envision being able to do more of it for some of my less productive &amp;quot;Internet Properties&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part it has nothing to do with any of this business of busy-ness, but about the wonderful Dharma of Patrul Rinpoche, who I&amp;#39;m reading now.  One of the central truths that emerges from the book is the importance of meditating on impermanence.  That is to say, neither ParticleWave nor my other sites are unlikely to survive into the next century, and it&amp;#39;s certain that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; won&amp;#39;t survive into the next century.  Nor is it even guaranteed I&amp;#39;ll make it until five o&amp;#39;clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some motivational cat -- Richard Robbins?  someone else? -- posed the rhetorical question, &amp;quot;What would you do if you knew you couldn&amp;#39;t fail?&amp;quot;  Buddhism a la Rinpoche stands the question on its head, yet with an even more liberating result:  &amp;quot;What will you do now that you are certain to fail (die)?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vastness of suffering and death, how can we be anything but kind?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Contract Firms, Two Car Funerals, and Quality Assurance</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, the manager on the contract I was working for called me in to his office to let me know he was paying a lot more for me to the contract firm I was working under than he thought he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a conversation that was destined to go poorly.   In fact, it was pretty much downhill from the point where he told me he could get two programmers for what I was making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I thought my rates were pretty reasonable, at market or at worst only about 10% above.  And of course they were, but it turns out I was only making 52% of what the contract firm was billing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what languages the two programmers who replace me will speak.  Probably Elbonian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the upshot is that on Friday I decided that I wanted to work on LeadReply -- my neglected pet project -- for free more than I wanted a 25% pay cut.  So that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing, and it&amp;#39;s well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting project, in that it&amp;#39;s completely underfunded.  I have scope to work on it for maybe two months, and certainly to do everything I want to do is four months or so of work at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was working on the classes that will parse the leads when they come in.  There&amp;#39;s no rocket science there, just a lot of looking at text emails of various types and pulling strings out.  I was almost done the parsing code for most of the types I needed to handle on the first day, when it occurred to me that I was using something of a brute force approach, and needed to do some easy refactoring to make the code less fat and more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated to bite the bullet and do this, since string parsing code is so ad hoc and yet so menial that it&amp;#39;s always little fun.  But then I told myself something that was destined to be put on this blog.  I thought, &amp;quot;You know, you might as well do this job right, since after all you&amp;#39;re not getting paid for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how I also do the jobs I&amp;#39;m paid for, of course -- but in that case where&amp;#39;s the joke?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Subversion for Windows, etc.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s Saturday morning, and what better time to extend one&amp;#39;s programming skills.  Get 2/3 of a night&amp;#39;s sleep on Friday night, and wake up before the sun to write some Transact SQL for the realcrm project I&amp;#39;m working on, and along the way go install and start using &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91&quot;&gt;Subversion for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that was just a pleasure.  Install the thing, restart 4NT, read for 10 to 20 minutes, and hey, I&amp;#39;m checking things out and committing and gosh knows what.  The only thing remotely like a hickup was the error message that I needed to set $SVN_EDITOR, so I added that to my 4NT startup batch file and away I went.  Just what I wanted, version control for use on my personal products that runs fine from the command line and costs what I wanted to pay for version control for my personal projects, i.e., nothing.  Of course, if you must use a GUI instead of a command prompt, and if talk of 4NT has you scratching your head, then check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;Tortoise SVN&lt;/a&gt;, which integrates SVN into Windows Exploder.  But don&amp;#39;t ask me whether that part works or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[C:]  Real men use the command prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/geek&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit later, I&amp;#39;m going to go into my realcrm project and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=Frozzled+the+sub+space+winch&amp;amp;btnG=Search&quot;&gt;Frozzle the Sub Space Winch&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#39;ve been thinking that it needed a good Frozzling -- just been waiting to have a 32-bit left handed frozzler to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have gone for 3/3 of a night&amp;#39;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Great SQL Server Site</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was just doing a bit of SQL Server hacking this evening to brush up my skills in that area, and I happened across this outstanding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlteam.com/&quot;&gt;SQL Server Site&lt;/a&gt; that I thought I&amp;#39;d mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I&amp;#39;m jonesing for yet another web site host, where I can play around with some .NET and SQL server application development.  Meantime, the real estate sites are split between two separate hosts already, so I&amp;#39;m a bit hesitant in that regard, but at least one of the SQL Team authors gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orcsweb.com/&quot;&gt;Orcs Web&lt;/a&gt; a fairly glowing writeup.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>More C# Exam Samples</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve uploaded the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/dot_net/MicrosoftCertificationExam70-536.php&quot;&gt;Sample Code for Exam 70-536&lt;/a&gt;.  This batch includes the ICollection etc. samples posted last time as well as a few halting forays into ConfigurationManager -- there&amp;#39;s more to do in that section, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not very happy with how the code formatting is going given the layout of the Particlewave site.  I just don&amp;#39;t have enough room between the navigation and the right hand links to get a decent line of code in, it seems.  We&amp;#39;ll have to look into that further, or give up the idea of blogging about code -- I don&amp;#39;t like the latter alternative at all.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;ll have a few tests from this NUnit test suite posted here on the blog shortly too to give you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>When is a test not a test.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s a classroom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I admit it, I&amp;#39;m being obtuse.  As programmers sometimes say to being caught in the act of being obtuse, &amp;quot;Why Do You Think They Call It &amp;#39;Code&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/JUnit.php&quot;&gt;JUnit&lt;/a&gt; unit tests in the past, and and one could say that I was able to parlay my current contract based on my experiences with test first design, since the client in this case was interested in someone experienced with Xtreme Programming, and test first design and development is one of XPs cornerstone processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed, at work it wasn&amp;#39;t long before we had an NUnit test suite going -- I&amp;#39;ve been plugging my way through our new database test suite for a few days now.  The coolest thing (in my opinion) to happen to unit testing in the time since I first used JUnit is automatic test composition.  Back in the JUnit days, you had to create (and -- worse -- you had to maintain) a TestSuite.  In NUnit, there&amp;#39;s no such restriction, simply mark the test classes and methods you want with the appropriate [TestFixture] and [Test] attributes, respectively, and you&amp;#39;re off and running.  We&amp;#39;re using Namespaces to organize our tests in a visually appealing and logical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today when I got Visual Studio installed, it also occured to me that NUnit is an ideal &amp;quot;snippet viewer&amp;quot; sort of an application, the kind of thing that&amp;#39;s ideal for organizing and writing code to learn new things and excercise unfamiliar classes -- which of course is just the sort of thing if you&amp;#39;re preparing for a certification exam.  So a test (in the software sense) is not a test when it&amp;#39;s a classroom to help you prepare for a test (in the academic sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to work in that way for awhile, developing my sample &amp;quot;apps&amp;quot; (i.e., learning exercises) in NUnit, and perhaps I&amp;#39;ll publish them up here for what it&amp;#39;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using the Wordpress Code Markup Plugin</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I just found Bennet&amp;#39;s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/code-markup-wordpress-plugin/&quot;&gt;Code Markup Plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and with it, I was able to pretty quickly fix the post about C Sharp Verbatim Strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew some smart guy would have written that, and sure enough, he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With very little extra work, I was able to get some cool formatting going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cool Formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;code&amp;quot; allow=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
using System;
using System.Text;

public class Hello
{

    public static void Main()
    {
    String verbatim =

@&amp;quot;This is a
verbatim string, and it can go
on and on, using &amp;quot;&amp;quot;quote&amp;quot;&amp;quot; characters
etc but everything else
is not escaped, like tab characters, \t
and so forth.&amp;quot;;

    System.Console.Write(verbatim);
    }
}
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

				<title>Visual Studio Arrived</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it&amp;#39;s installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn&amp;#39;t Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp&quot;&gt;Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0—Application Development Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which I was planning to take anyway.  Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And heck, thinks are looking up.  We&amp;#39;re on CD 2 already.   Of course, I remember Borland C++ on 21 floppies...&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>C# Verbatim Strings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just doing a bit of hacking with the C Sharp mono compiler this evening.  (I&amp;#39;m waiting for Visual Studio to ship -- what else?).  Meantime I may have found my first error in Donis Marshall&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=sacramentorea-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0735621810%2Fqid%3D1151639146%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155&quot;&gt;Programming Microsoft Visual C# 2005:  The Language&lt;/a&gt; -- which doesn&amp;#39;t bode incredibly well given that I&amp;#39;m only on page 23 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at verbatim strings, Marshall neglects to point out that to escape a string inside a verbatim string you use double quotes, not backslash quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a braindead example of the right way to do it.  Mono users use mcs VerbatimString.cs to compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`
using System;
using System.Text;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public class VerbatimStrings
{
    public static void Main()
    {
    String verbatim =&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&amp;quot;This is a
verbatim string, and it can go
on and on, using &amp;quot;&amp;quot;quote&amp;quot;&amp;quot; characters
etc but everything else
is not escaped, like tab characters, \t
and so forth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;System.Console.Write(verbatim);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;}`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, it took about three times as long to write the blog post as it did to figure it out to begin with.  I love trying to write code in HTML.  There should be a wordpress plugin or the like for that...&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.NET Contract in Sacramento Going Well</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The ASP.NET contract I&amp;#39;m doing in Sac is going quite well so far.  It&amp;#39;s a small and really congenial team, and in less than a week I started to make some good progress on some of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some minor hiccups -- development anti-patterns, if you will -- but it doesn&amp;#39;t look like anything too dire.  Some of this involves existing code written by a now-missing contractor,  which is always a delicate matter.  Everyone likes the guy and he&amp;#39;s clearly very sharp in his work, but some of the underlying framework of his that we&amp;#39;re coding too may have a bit of architectural gold plating (which is not so bad in itself except in insofar as it may violate the Pragmatic &amp;quot;DRY&amp;quot; rule).  A little more of a concern is that it may drive our efforts in the wrong direction as far as being fat / difficult to fix (which IS so bad in itself).  Must learn more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just code, which can always be fixed or tossed.  The really tough job -- good management and a team that gets along well -- is already in place.  Without that no amount of code will save you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, being in Visual Studio again is a treat.  It&amp;#39;s always had a fairly competent debugger -- and let&amp;#39;s face it, as a programmer, that&amp;#39;s home.  I keep a SlickEdit window open for the heavy editorial lifting, of course.  The new SourceSafe integration is flawless so far, too, and that&amp;#39;s quite nice.  I&amp;#39;m starting to get a pretty good feel for ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ASP.NET 2.0 Programming: Hooray, New Gig!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful to my good friends at Robert Half for the exciting gig we&amp;#39;re working on now, developing in ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005.  I&amp;#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&amp;#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, after real estate, I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind a LOT of job security, which is why I&amp;#39;m seriously considering just doing .NET alone for the foreseeable future.  Java&amp;#39;s cool enough, but I don&amp;#39;t think it would hurt my current prospects to maybe do some certifications -- and it would certainly help my current client if I threw myself into some spare time .NET hacking in preparation for those certifications, even if in the end I decide the certifications themselves are a superfluous expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t be surprised if a lot of what you read here in the months ahead ends up being about the Road to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/webapps/&quot;&gt;.NET 2.0 Certification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/&quot;&gt;Author&amp;#39;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using Ant and XDoclet with JDO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the simple joys in programming is trying out new little hacks designed to prove a concept or try out something previously unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I last used Java, Ant was a fairly new thing, and for some reason I had a lot of resistance to learning it.  Now, Ant and Maven are fairly ubiquitous.   Also, I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to take on some work in XDoclet, since it seems like almost everywhere you look -- whether in EJB or in &amp;quot;lightweight&amp;quot; POJO tools like hibernate or JDO, there&amp;#39;s still some heavyweight XML configuration or metadata that needs to either get generated or maintained.   (No wonder Java 1.5 adds support for attributes -- and no wonder again that Ruby on Rails finds &amp;quot;favoring convention over configuration&amp;quot; to be a perfectly legitimate marketing strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I do have some working code hacked together for using Ant and XDoclet and JDO -- here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/hacks/AntXdocletJDOHacks.zip&quot;&gt;Zip File&lt;/a&gt;.  src.com.particlewave.apps contains the java code, and build.xml is of course the Ant script.  To run it, you&amp;#39;ll need &lt;a href=&quot;http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html&quot;&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.junit.org/index.htm&quot;&gt;junit&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#39;ll need to have a lib directory with the unzipped jars from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/install.html&quot;&gt;XDoclet libraries&lt;/a&gt; available to ant on it&amp;#39;s classpath.  For my first hack I was just working on getting XDoclet working to create JDO configuration files.  Some good help in that direction came from JPox&amp;#39;s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jpox.org/docs/1_1/xdoclet.html&quot;&gt;XDoclet JDO example&lt;/a&gt;.  Another sample I discovered later is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solarmetric.com/Software/Documentation/3.4.0/docs/ref_guide_integration_xdoclet.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jpox sample helped me debug a nasty and obscure problem with my own code.  It turns out that -- for jdo at least, I haven&amp;#39;t tried xdoclet in general on this -- you need to have your comments in the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/**
   *  Double asterisks on first comment line.
   *
*/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/*
   * See the single asterisk on first comment line.
   *
*/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a single asterisk will create a JDO file, but even if your @jdo.whatever tags are all correct, the file will be empty.  This was a bit cumbersome to track down, so I point it out in case someone else puts their leg in the same bear trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>HP d4100e Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My HP d4100e arrived while I was at a &amp;quot;Zoo Overnighter&amp;quot; with my daughter, so naturally I was excited to see the big cardboard box in the living room when I returned, a sign of impending hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit I purchased was a dual core AMD Athlon 4200, with 2 Gb of RAM, so finally I have a substantial development box to work with here, no cheesy underpowered laptop.  So far I&amp;#39;ve thrown the JBoss Application Server and Eclipse&amp;#39;s Java IDE at it and it took that and 120 meg of Firefox windows in stride.  Performance has been fine, though it&amp;#39;s interesting to note that there are some things about Windows that are just slow anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than start-up, which sounds like a brief and minor train wreck, operation is very quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a nice set of included utilities, including PC Doctor and a bunch of junk I haven&amp;#39;t tried out yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first day it was set up, with the included wireless mouse and keyboard, I had two fairly nasty hangs of the &amp;quot;hard boot -- pull the plug&amp;quot; variety.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if the mouse and keyboard are really the culprits, but I thought I&amp;#39;d replace them with my wired PS2 ergonomic keyboard and my old mouse to see what I could see.  So far since then I&amp;#39;ve gone through a day with no hangs at all -- knock wood that&amp;#39;s solved.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, compared to the issue above -- which if unsolved would be a a heart-breaking call support or heaven forbid wrap it up and send it back -- nothing else is really to complain about, but the box is a bit of hefty and large.  In my younger days I&amp;#39;d consider that a benefit, now I no longer need to play inside so I call it a defect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system came with a pre-installed 60 day trial of a version of Outlook, Outlook 2003.  No, thanks, I&amp;#39;ll skip the upsell.  My old version serves just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>More on Ruby Programming</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been digging a little more into Ruby, and I definitely get what the excitement is about.  As a few authors have said, Ruby strikes one as &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/xml_matters_18.html&quot;&gt;Perl done right&lt;/a&gt;.   I loved PERL, even when it was done wrong, so needless to say I&amp;#39;m really having a blast in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you havent done so yet, I&amp;#39;d encourage you to go up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby Web Site&lt;/a&gt;, download Ruby, and check out the Prgagmatic Programmer&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html&quot;&gt;Ruby Book&lt;/a&gt; for a great free introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently working on automating my real estate business using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lickey.com/rubymail/&quot;&gt;Ruby Mail&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to thank Xinizul for his excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;amp;aid=2597&amp;amp;group_id=426&amp;amp;atid=1698&quot;&gt;fix for Rubymail on Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which saved me several hours in the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New Hardware On It’s Way</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Q.  How many computer programmers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.  None, that&amp;#39;s hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally broke down and decided that it was time to get off this minimalist sales guy laptop I&amp;#39;m using and get some real development hardware in here.  After all, I have to go play API alphabet soup on job interviews, so I want to make sure I can tell an SOA from a POJO.  So I ordered a nice development machine from HP, and it should be here in a couple of weeks -- hopefully less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to a friend from my VSP / Synergex days today, looks like I can still hold my own fairly well on the technobabble.  But there are a number of things I never tried out, back in the day, and a few things that have either developed or appeared since.  Time to start hacking again -- hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, apropos the acronyms, the fact that now we have an acronym for the Plain Old Java Objects we should have been coding in all along is fairly amusing.  Unfortunately I&amp;#39;m still seeing statements of work for the Dark Side of the Force -- EJBs, of course -- so it&amp;#39;s a little to early to make a stand on the virtue of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ruby on Rails</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Of course, now that I&amp;#39;m brushing off my software hat -- a four-prop beanie, presumably -- I&amp;#39;m opening Dr. Dobb&amp;#39;s Journal when it comes in the mail.  The lastest edition talks about the buzz surrounding Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there&amp;#39;s a fair amount of hype in Dr. Dobbs about this language / enviornment.  Moreover,  quick search on Dice shows that it&amp;#39;s a bit too early to declare it &amp;quot;Java&amp;#39;s Successor&amp;quot; just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To praphrase the Monkees, however:  &amp;quot;But then I saw the videos.  Now I&amp;#39;m a Believer&amp;quot;.  Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/screencasts&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails Screencasts &lt;/a&gt; for yourself.  Building a web log in 15 minutes was fun, but I especially liked &amp;quot;Evolving your database schema without a sweat&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is seriously cool stuff, even if Java&amp;#39;s still beating it by a clean 14370 keyword hits to 26.  What is this, some kind of popularity contest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for cash flow purposes at least:  Yep.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Programming in Sacramento</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#39;s time to order a nice speedy computer so we can load it up with the sort of slow software that people will pay you to work on.  Interestingly enough, functional open source works great for the self-employed, but to work in the software you have to have at least a grudging aquaintance with some bloated commercial apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, that&amp;#39;s all we did at ParticleWave -- go find software contractor positions and work on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ll be getting back to that, and having more to say about Java in the weeks ahead, especially focusing on struts, EJBs, and other good stuff with a level of complexity sufficient to satsify the complexity-junky programmers who are advising the managers who are making the hiring decisions.  As a wise man told me when I was very, very new to the software business -- &amp;quot;learn something that looks hard, because people will pay you more to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Seven Deadly Reciprocal Linking Sins</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After every major Google update, it seems, someone will come out with a new obituary, announcing the death of reciprocal linking.  And it&amp;#39;s true that in recent years, Google seems to have downplayed reciprocal linking in their algorithm.  Yet for all of that, reciprocal linking is alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why reciprocal linking survives.  First, though they are the biggest game in town, Google is certainly not the only game, and Yahoo and MSN continue to put significant weight on reciprocal links.  Secondly, the search engines aren&amp;#39;t the only reason to link -- you can also expect some traffic directly from the link itself.  Finally, even in the case of Google, all is not lost.  Though they have downplayed reciprocal linking, there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be too much evidence to suggest that Google actively penalizes them.  (That said, you should read their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html&quot;&gt;webmaster guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for specific advice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with anything else related to your web site traffic, however, it&amp;#39;s important to have some guidelines before setting out.   Too often we see Realtors® doing reciprocal linking in a way that will give them less benefit, or no benefit at all.  Here are specific mistakes we think you should avoid when you set out to include a link directory on your site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having all your links on one page, or too few pages&lt;/strong&gt;.  Google recommends that you keep your links to a &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; number, fewer than 100 per page.  Unfortunately many of the link directories set up on Z57 and Advanced Access sites that have linked to us violate that very rule.  It may be that those sites can be configured differently.  The custom sites we offer solve this problem by automatically limiting the number of links per page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking to all comers, part I:  &amp;quot;bad neighborhoods&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.   Google suggests you should avoid links to web spammers and bad neighborhoods.   At the very least, it&amp;#39;s worthwhile to see if the site has been banned by Google.  Go to Google and type in &amp;quot;site:www.potentialpartner.com&amp;quot; (substituting the real main web site address for your potential partner, of course).  You should see something like &amp;quot;Results 1 - 10 of about [some number] from www.potentiallinkpartner.com&amp;quot;.  If Google isn&amp;#39;t indexing anything at all, then either the site is brand new and not indexed yet (wait), or it has been banned (don&amp;#39;t reciprocate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking to all comers, part II:  no theme&lt;/strong&gt;.  Your goal in linking to other sites is partially to get other sites linking back, but also you want to establish -- both for the search engines and your users -- a reputation as an authority on real estate.   Yes, that texas holdem site may link back to you, but so what?  How is that related to your theme, and what does it say about your site that you link to it?  Your focus should be first and foremost on real estate, and secondarily on related topics (local resources, real estate finance, lenders, etc.)  Ask yourself:  would a user of my site (someone moving or an investor) potentially find this of interest?  If the answer is no, don&amp;#39;t swap links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking to all comers, part III:  no quality control&lt;/strong&gt;.   A site can be indexed by the search engines and be related to real estate, and still fail to be a site you should link to.   I&amp;#39;m not talking about becoming the ultimate web site critic, but you should have a few basic standards in place.  I personally want to see some sort of unique content, not just a link directory, and especially not just a link directory with a bunch of affiliate marketing / adsense ads.   Again, would a user of your site be interested in a bunch of links and some advertising?  If not, why are you linking to it?  I prefer sites that are established.  If they&amp;#39;re new, I at least like them to look like they&amp;#39;re not under construction.  I definitely don&amp;#39;t mind cosmetically unusual sites from fellow Realtors® -- often these home grown sites have the most real interesting content, even if some look a bit odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying no attention to search engines&lt;/strong&gt;.  I often copy the page the webmaster offers to link to me from into Google, Yahoo, and MSN.  I like to see that my link will appear on a page that&amp;#39;s indexed by at least one of the major engines, or if the quality of the site is borderline, I like it to be indexed by two or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying too much attention to search engines&lt;/strong&gt;.  On the other extreme from being oblivious to search are those link partners who approach me with something like  &amp;quot;I have a PR6 site and will link from a PR4 page in exchange for a link on your PR3 page here and your PR2 page here&amp;quot;.   Forget page rank -- focus on quality links to and from quality sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring link text&lt;/strong&gt;.   Link text is the text that appears underlined when the link is published, and tells users whether they&amp;#39;re linking to &lt;em&gt;Peggy Sue McFeelgood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;South Carolina Real Estate&lt;/em&gt;.  We feel that -- in general -- the text of the link should match the title text of the page you&amp;#39;re linking to, and this should match the keyword you want to target.   At the other extreme, however, having every single site that links to you link to the same page with the same keyword text may appear like an attempt to spam the engine, so don&amp;#39;t overdo it.  We will sometimes alternate betweeen keyword phrases, and if a webmaster uses URLs for link text instead of keyword phrases, we&amp;#39;ll ask for those links, too.  Also, if a webmaster gets the link text &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;, we frequently will let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Real Estate Video Marketing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re starting to explore the video and audio to get our sellers&amp;#39; homes sold and the message out about our team.   Two trends have come together to make this a good time to get into this.  First, most homes that have Internet now have high speed connections, cable modems or DSL.  Secondly, DVD players have come down in price and are now nearly ubiquitous, and media is becoming more inexpensive, allowing us to use the same message in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re working with a local firm to produce a DVD to help sellers whose listings have expired without selling to understand what they need to do to get their home sold.  Our target date for that is April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime, we have our first work product, a little 30-second spot showing how our search results help market our sellers&amp;#39; homes.  Check it out below. (I know, it&amp;#39;s not exactly Cecil B. DeMille, but give me a break, it&amp;#39;s my first one).                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>First Free Content Article</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve put up my first free real estate content article.  It&amp;#39;s here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.particlewave.com/freecontent/Expired101.php&quot;&gt;Show Me a Five Dollar Bill, and I&amp;#39;ll Show You Why Your Listing Expired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to do one a week, since this is the year I&amp;#39;m trying to get away from those silly looking little link directories, but in the meantime I need to find some way for the search engines to find me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll do another post soon about some of the resources I find useful as I dig further into article submission.  One that&amp;#39;s already been somewhat helpful and generated a few ideas is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.submityourarticle.com&quot;&gt;SubmitYourArticle.com&lt;/a&gt;.  They&amp;#39;re web site is pretty much an opt-in email list, but so far it&amp;#39;s pretty much been just good solid information.  I&amp;#39;m not at the point of recommending their article submission services yet, however.  I&amp;#39;m still looking at many of the folks out there writing, and trying to understand how much their writing helps their search positions, but I&amp;#39;m somewhat wary of the effect of automated services given the web&amp;#39;s history with link submission services and the like.  If anyone&amp;#39;s used SubmitYourArticle.com or another article submission service and wants to be interviewed, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
