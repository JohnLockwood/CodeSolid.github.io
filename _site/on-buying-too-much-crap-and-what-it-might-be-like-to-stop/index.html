            <h2>On Buying Too Much Crap, and What It Might Be Like to Stop</h2>
<p class="meta">04 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I buy too much crap.  The chances are pretty good that you do, too.  Actually, the chances are even better that you&#39;re a spambot, but let&#39;s leave to one side the issue of my low readership for now.  If you&#39;re here as a human denizen of the interwebs, you probably buy about as much crap as I do.</p>

<p>Two days ago I started writing down how much crap I buy, and the unusual effect of that, a couple of days later, is that what I really want to do is start an experiment where I don&#39;t buy any crap for a period of time -- let&#39;s say a month.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s food and rent and all that, and there are the inevitable and welcome social obligations to spend money on -- dinner with my daughter and flowers for my wife, the two things I bought on Wednesday when I began writing things down.  But there&#39;s no need to buy all that other crap that may sing it&#39;s little &quot;Buy Me&quot; siren song in my ear over the next month.</p>

<p>I was thinking about buying a book I saw yesterday, partly for me and partly for my wife.  The irony of this thought is that I saw the book in a public library, where borrowing the book wouldn&#39;t have cost me a cent, and I would have less crap to put on a shelf at the end of the process.</p>

<p>This might not be a bad thing.  The shelves are already doing OK.  </p>

<p>The cupboards are doing even better. My wife and I have, as of this moment, in the house (leaving off my stash at work), some fifteen boxes of teabags.  Now even with that, a week ago I bought a loose leaf tea infuser and some tea. </p>

<p>What the hell do I need an infuser for, when I have a cupboard with fifteen boxes of tea?</p>

<p>Well, I wanted one.  I went up on Amazon -- yes, of course I&#39;m an Amazon Prime member, are you kidding me?  I went up on Amazon and the crap-buying centers of my brain instantly lit up like a department store Christmas tree.</p>

<p>So now I have a tea infuser, and a notebook to write down the crap I buy.  I&#39;m proud to say I used an existing notebook for that -- no new crap to track the crap.  </p>

<p>Also, I am going to start using up the tea.  In order to enjoy my new purchase, I&#39;m going to bring some of those boxes to work and use my free work scissors to cut them open -- hey presto, loose leaf tea.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know how it all goes.</p>
