<div class="post">
<p>Last Thursday, the manager on the contract I was working for called me in to his office to let me know he was paying a lot more for me to the contract firm I was working under than he thought he was.</p>

<p>This was a conversation that was destined to go poorly.   In fact, it was pretty much downhill from the point where he told me he could get two programmers for what I was making.</p>

<p>And here I thought my rates were pretty reasonable, at market or at worst only about 10% above.  And of course they were, but it turns out I was only making 52% of what the contract firm was billing for me.</p>

<p>I wonder what languages the two programmers who replace me will speak.  Probably Elbonian.</p>

<p>Anyway, the upshot is that on Friday I decided that I wanted to work on LeadReply -- my neglected pet project -- for free more than I wanted a 25% pay cut.  So that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s well underway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting project, in that it&#39;s completely underfunded.  I have scope to work on it for maybe two months, and certainly to do everything I want to do is four months or so of work at minimum.</p>

<p>Today I was working on the classes that will parse the leads when they come in.  There&#39;s no rocket science there, just a lot of looking at text emails of various types and pulling strings out.  I was almost done the parsing code for most of the types I needed to handle on the first day, when it occurred to me that I was using something of a brute force approach, and needed to do some easy refactoring to make the code less fat and more maintainable.</p>

<p>I hated to bite the bullet and do this, since string parsing code is so ad hoc and yet so menial that it&#39;s always little fun.  But then I told myself something that was destined to be put on this blog.  I thought, &quot;You know, you might as well do this job right, since after all you&#39;re not getting paid for it.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I also do the jobs I&#39;m paid for, of course -- but in that case where&#39;s the joke?</p>
