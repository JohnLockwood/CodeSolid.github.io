      If you&#39;ve taken a look at the <a href="https://github.com/CodeSolid/tutorials">Github Repository</a> for the CodeSolid tutorials, you may have noticed that the project files all use IntelliJ Idea.  I use the Ultimate Edition (currently Version 12) for most of my development, but recently I promised to look into using these project files in Eclipse.  I had a feeling it would work since I have sourced the Maven project -- i.e., the POM files, those named pom.xml in the root of each tutorial -- but being the good test infected developer that I am, I try not to take &quot;that should work&quot; for granted.

We'll show you how to take advantage of these special test runners to do basic Spring Unit testing.  We'll also teach you how to acquire an application context without using these runners, and though we'll demonstrate this using JUnit as well, the same techniques can be used in Standalone Spring applications or in other test frameworks like TestNG.  <a href="/spring/testing,%20junit,%20testng%20tutorials/tutorials/2013/05/16/spring-unit-testing-using-junit.html">Read more</a>...

      I spent more time than I&#39;d like to admit yesterday on a problem with Devise that I was seeing on a Rails application that I was deploying to production.  Like most head-scratcher bugs that we as software developers track down, the solution often appears blindingly obvious -- once we find it, of course.  What happened was that my Devise routes, which had worked fine on the development server, suddenly stopped working when I moved the app to production.

      I haven&#39;t wanted to really dig into a software language in a long time, but I&#39;ve been brushing up my Ruby and Rails skills and enjoying it thoroughly. It&#39;s still fun even if I only get to do it in my spare time. I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of making money at it yet, and currently I make a living digging up dinosaur bones in what we will charitably call C++ since that&#39;s what the file extensions seem to denote.

      I got a very good email yesterday from <a href="http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/">Free Speech for People</a> summarizing some of the progress we&#39;re making against corporate personhood, encouraging me to ask my representative to co-sponsor the People&#39;s Rights Amendment house resolution, which overturns Citizens United.  (Read the resolution in <a href="http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/sites/default/files/Peoples%20Rights%20Amendment.pdf">PDF format</a>).  Here&#39;s the suggestion, which I&#39;ve followed (and urge you to do the same).  It took me about 3 minutes.

      Recently, my life seems to be full of things I never imagined. Indeed, being a few weeks away from turning 51 is itself something I never imagined. My father died when he was 47, and given the way I behaved in my younger days, I was convinced I’d also leave my myriad fans behind some time in my forties, so in this respect each additional moment comes as a surprise. Apparently the fortuitous combination of maternal genetics and the adage that “only the good die young” has offered me a measure of protection.

The rest follows easily: return 0 when both objects are equal and > 0 when this instance greater than obj passed to CompareTo. Remember, this is self centered so everything’s in terms of this.

      In .NET, delegates are classes that implement type safe function pointers.  Like all function pointers, they can be used whereever you need dynamic execution of code.  One use of delegates that is ubiquitous in .NET is as a mechanism for handling events.  Both ASP.NET Webforms and the Windows development Winforms classes uses such delegates as event handlers.  So does our little program below, which shows how to translate keypresses into events, then handle certain events as they&#39;re raised.

      The memory for reference types is allocated on the system heap, so it makes sense that reference variables can be null. Value types, in contrast, cannot be assigned a &quot;null” value by default. Still, there are times when you may want to declare a int (for example) and allow it to be set null – one obvious use is in reading and writing data from a database. Enter the Nullable type. Here’s a brief sample that shows how these types work.

      What does having a better blog mean to you?  Does it mean a big four or five-digit subscriber count?  How about a steady stream of people who start commenting on your posts almost as soon as they hit your site?  Do you want more page views because more page views means more advertising revenue, or are you content with capturing a smaller, focused niche in the search engines to help you sell your product or service?  Do you want to convert more of your visitors to closed sales, or are you simply trying to reach a larger audience with your message?

      AdSense and I have a checkered past.  I had an account several years ago, but never made much from it.  Last week I decided that really ought to take another look at ad networks like AdSense, since I believe that Pro Blogger / Online Publisher is a legitimate career path for an Internet writer (albeit one with a long start-up curve and a crowded field).

      If you&#39;re a writer working on the Internet, Bob Younce&#39;s <a href="http://writing-journey.com">Writing Journey</a> is one of the blogs you should be reading.  I&#39;m not saying this because Bob&#39;s blog is an easy read, though don&#39;t get me wrong, his style is fine.  Bob&#39;s blog can be a tough read because it&#39;s loaded with the kind of advice that makes you think &quot;You know, darn it, he&#39;s right -- that is something I should be doing a better job at doing.&quot;  For example, his article <a href="http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/4-keys-to-establishing-your-brand-as-an-internet-writer">4 Keys to Establishing Your Brand as an Internet Writer</a> reminded me of the fact that this blog, Inklit, had yet to settle on what it wants to be when it grows up.  Am I writing for would-be Internet writers, sharing my journey from a one-client-wonder to a writer who&#39;s succeeding online?  Or am I changing the title tag to Internet Writer and going for the gusto as a search engine optimized sales piece?  Or am I just another ProBlogger wannabe <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jamoke">jamoke</a> with an AdSense account, a pink carnation and a pickup truck?

      RSS stands for &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;, and it allows you to subscribe to blogs and news sites you like so you&#39;ll be able to read them whenever they get updated, without having to go check the site to see if there&#39;s anything new. You do this using an RSS reader, which can either be a web site type reader or software that you install on your computer.

You don&#39;t have to have an &quot;Internet-only&quot; marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we&#39;ll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we&#39;re looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.

      I don&#39;t usually like blogs with a lot of Adsense ads staring you in the face. However, I did enjoy Brandon Cornett&#39;s article on <a href="http://www.armingyourfarming.com/">How to Write a Real Estate Ad - Magazine Ad Writing 101</a>. Too often we speak in generalities like &quot;excellent customer service&quot;, and Brandon talks about how to get down to specific real estate stories of interest and calls to action.

      Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it&#39;s installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn&#39;t Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0—Application Development Foundation</a>, which I was planning to take anyway.

I&#39;m very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft&#39;s tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.
