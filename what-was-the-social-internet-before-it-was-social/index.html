          <h2>What Was the Social Internet Before It Was Social?</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Dec 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Do you remember the anti-social Internet, where nothing was connected to anything and no one communicated using it?</p>

<p>Neither do I.</p>

<p>From its outset, the Internet has been about people sharing and communicating information and ideas.  In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee first conceived of a hypertext project at CERN as a means for researchers information.  In August of 1991 the first web site was put online at CERN, and we&#39;ve been all typing up a storm ever since.  In addition to web sites and the tools to browse them, the first killer app of the Internet was e-mail.</p>

<p>In addition to email and web sites, electronic bulletin board systems (BBSs) like the ones I frequented on Fidonet in the eighties were, as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Wikipedia article</a> correctly points out, a precursor to the World Wide Web.  You could say that we had a social Internet before we had an Internet, and the latter was just a bunch of protocols to run it on.</p>

<p><strong>Enter The Web 2.0 Now Here&#39;s Something We Hope You&#39;ll Really Like Social Internet</strong></p>

<p>For the last few years a lot of people have been spending a great deal of time on various social networking sites.  In 2006, Myspace allegedly reached the 100 million user mark -- a number that at least one geek has <a href="http://forevergeek.com/articles/debunking_the_myspace_myth_of_100_million_users.php">debunked</a>.  The popular real estate social networking site, ActiveRain,  also launched in 2006, and many agents and brokers including me have invested (squandered?) a great deal of time there.  More recently, I&#39;ve been amazed by how many messages I have whenever I log in at Facebook or Cre8Buzz or one of the other social networks I&#39;ve participated in -- and I&#39;m not really that popular a guy.  Ann Cummings invites me to use FunWall.  David Smith pokes me.  Oliver Muoto received a can of Whoop Ass.</p>

<p>Poor guy.</p>

<p>For awhile there I was getting email daily updates from Facebook, telling me the most inane things</p>

<p>I turned that off eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Seven Criticisms of the Social Internet</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>*<em>It&#39;s Amateur, in the sense that you don&#39;t get paid for it.
*</em><a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/">Andrew Keen</a> has probably written more about this criticism than anyone.  As a corollary, I agree with this argument, insofar as I&#39;ve made a decent living off of several web sites I&#39;ve created and maintained, but no money at all off of ActiveRain.  Even the referrals I&#39;ve received have not come from ActiveRain, but from people finding my own web sites.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>Someone&#39;s might be getting paid for it, but it won&#39;t be you.
*</em>One of the most amusing incidents in Move.com&#39;s failed acquisition of ActiveRain was this ActiveRain apologia about <a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/">who owns the content on ActiveRain</a>.  Still, I don&#39;t recall any discussion about how the thirty-million would have been shared if the transaction went through.  Oh.  See also, this article about <a href="http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/10/creating-your-own-internet-real-estate/">remodeling the kitchen in a house you rent</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>It&#39;s Amateur, in the sense of incompetent or unskilled
*</em>Think:  Myspace web pages.  Pink on purple, anyone?</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>It&#39;s Amateur, in the sense of trivial or unimportant
*</em>OK, this one&#39;s almost built in.  In order to socialize, human beings have to lighten up a bit on their seriousness.  Still, it does seem to me that one can base an adult friendship on banter a bit more sophisticated than throwing sheep at one another.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>You Can&#39;t Optimize for Every Web Site There Is
*</em>Every web site has its own rules for getting to a top ranked listing.  I prefer to shoot for the top of Google, Yahoo, and MSN in that order.  These are sites that buyers and sellers use when they&#39;re buying and selling, not socializing.  Yes, this means I&#39;ve had to give up my coveted #2 spot on ActiveRain.  So far I haven&#39;t noticed a difference.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It&#39;s Anonymous</strong>
Having their cake and eating it too, social Internet socialites believing in the absolute sanctity of open information (thou shalt not ever censor me), even if they don&#39;t sign their names or take responsibility for their actions.  Human-Powered Search Engine Mahalo goes a step further and recommends that instead of a photo of your human self, you &quot;Be Cool&quot; and use a Wee-Me Avatar instead.  Apparently being Human-Powered wasn&#39;t cool enough in its own right.</p></li>
<li><p>*<em>It Confuses Grouchiness with Erudition
*</em>With a hat tip to <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Vicomte_de_Chateaubriand/">Quote of the Day</a> and the Vicomte de Chateaubriand (famous consumer of steak), &quot;You Are Not superior just because you see the world in an odious light&quot;.  And yes, I do apply that criticism to myself as well, and see this as one of my less useful posts.  I can never get enough of the <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1771556">Internet Commenter Business Meeting</a>.  To be sure, that&#39;s not new, either.  We had the same sort of thing going on in Fidonet.  To puree a metaphor, there&#39;s something about sitting behind a keyboard without a real face in front of you that makes it harder to wag your tail.</p></li>
