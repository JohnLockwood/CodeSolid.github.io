On a business level, I'm so passionate about Internet marketing because it works so well.  But underneath it all, what really drives me is that I get such a boyish geek kick out of watching new web sites start to take off and start to be able to make their owners money.

So naturally it gives me great pleasure to see how successful Pete Thompson's [Illinois Mortgage Rates and News](http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/) is in after only a short time.  We've been having a phone conference every other day or so to get his new blog established, and it's really fun to see the creativity and humor he brings to bear.  For example, in a recent post, Pete [dispelled the myth](http://www.ptmortgage.com/blog/2007/12/05/despite-what-youve-heard-mortgage-companies-are-still-in-the-business-of-lending-money/) that mortgage brokers have packed it in and no one's getting loans any more.  (This point is less obvious than it appears.  Listening to some of my clients, I'm beginning to think that tales of people not qualifying for loans have taken on the status of urban legends!)

Pete's already had a few people stop by and comment, and he's indexed by some of the more important blog search engines and social networking services, and Google's started picking up his content as well.

What really gets me excited as well is that he's well on his way (we'll do a few more tweaks over the next few days), and he was able to accomplish this for about 1/6th the cost of one of my competitors.  So in the first year, he'll save some $2,800** **for the same results, and he'll continue to save year after year on his web hosting bill.
