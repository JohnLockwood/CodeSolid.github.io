Those of you who know me from my real estate brokerage may also know Purva Brown, who contributes to my real estate blog.  Purva also hosts a fine real estate blog of her own, [The Sacramento Real Estate Gal](http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com).  Purva joined my real estate company last year.  She originally thought she was taking on a mentor when it comes to search engine optimization and Internet marketing, but as it turned out, Purva's helped me to expand my writing horizons at least as much as I ever helped her.

Purva and I are currently hammering out an agreement to collaborate on several projects.  Our first is putting up an online store to help us market and sell e-books and PLR content.  If all goes well we should be launching our first product together, Purva's ebook for real estate investors, before the end of March.

As a real estate investor herself, Purva and her husband, James, went through their share of landlord horror stories.  [Landlord Land Mines](http://www.landlordlandmines.com) is the book Purva wished they'd had when had when they were getting started.  Landlord Land Mines is written both from her own experience and from the experience of many other landlords who she interviewed for the book.

Forget the theory and the spreadsheets -- Landlord Land Mines puts together decades of collective experience and stories from real investors, who teach you what you need to know and what you need to avoid.
