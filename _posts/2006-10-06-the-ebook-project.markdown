I am beginning work on an eBook project entitled "What Every Realtor® Should Know Before Buying a Web Site".

Some of the topics this eBook will explore will include custom sites versus template sites, IDX, search engine optimization, pay per click advertising, blogging, landing pages, reciprocal linking, and more.

In addition, I'm planning on reviewing the web sites that are available from several major web site vendors so that potential buyers will have an informed basis for comparison.

I may also discuss alternatives to developing a web site.  Let's face it, not everyone in the business cares about HTML and blogging and the like, but many agents still want to get leads from the Internet.  This pent up desire for business is feeding a thriving lead re-sale industry.

Within a few weeks, I'll set up a mailing list for those who might be interested in learning more about the eBook as I develop it, and I will probably use content that I send to the mailing list members as the basis for what will become the eBook.

Needless to say, there's a lot to learn and put together to get this done, and I welcome input from Realtors® about their experiences with different web site companies and lead providers.
