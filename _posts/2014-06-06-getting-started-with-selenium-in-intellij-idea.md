Selenium is a one of the most popular test automation tools.  Selenium lets you write automated tests to drive a variety of popular browsers including Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Using Selenium IDE, you can record browser sessions and export the recorded tests to test cases written in a variety of languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET.  These tests can then be easily extended within that language to add assertions to verify that the test case passed.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through all the basics of using Selenium, from recording your first browser session using Selenium IDE, to setting up and running your JUnit tests in IntelliJ Idea.
