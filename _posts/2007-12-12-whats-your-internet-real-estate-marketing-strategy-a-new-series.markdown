One of the things that always interests me is hearing from others about what sorts of things they're doing to make business happen.  Naturally, the piece that I'm most interested in is what sort of things they're doing on the Internet to make things happen, since Internet real estate marketing is my passion, specialty, and business.

Those who've read me know that I have some pretty strong opinions as to what one's strategy _should _be, and about what works and what doesn't.  But the reason it's so interesting to hear from others is that I certainly don't think what I'm doing is the only way to get it right.  I'm passionate about sharing what I am doing because it's worked so well, but that doesn't mean it's the only thing that works.  There are other approaches that either are completely different or complementary.  Even while I'm working on my core strategy, I always find myself wondering if there isn't some other technique or project I should be incorporating to help my business grow.

What I'd like to do in a future post, therefore, is to try to take a really comprehensive look at my own marketing strategy, and talk about what I think works and what I've always felt were the strengths as well as the limitations of my approach.  After that, I'm going to be inviting other RealtorsÂ® and mortgage brokers to share what sorts of approaches have worked for them.  I'll put together a list of questions as a guide for authors so that you won't have to start completely from scratch unless you want to.  I already have some ideas in mind about people I'd like to invite, but if you have some ideas and would like to contribute an article on this topic, [please let me know](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/contact).
