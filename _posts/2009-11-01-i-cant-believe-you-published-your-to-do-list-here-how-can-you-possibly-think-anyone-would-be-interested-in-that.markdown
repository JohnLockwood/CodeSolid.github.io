Things to do:

 

  
  * Stop being so boring.        

   
  * Stop assuming folks will appreciate introspective jokes.        

   
  * Separate ParticleWave and ASPWorkbench further – all the ASP and certification stuff on ASPWorkbench, and all the company related Employee Owned Software stuff on ParticleWave.        

   
  * ASPWorkbench will also need a reasonable home page. Readers, don’t go there until I do. Trust me. It’s not even sophomoric.   

   
  * Rework the ParticleWave navigation to reflect the new division of labor.        

   
  * Publish the draft ParticleWave Employee Owned Software Company charter.        

   
  * Be not afraid of losing your day job. You need to say what you need to say. This is your outside blog. Be of good cheer.        

   
  * Write your open source-ialism article.       

   
  * .htaccess Forward ParticleWave’s ASP content to ASPWorkbench.       

   
  * Get permission from your client to write about him, then do, putting the Portfolio page back up.       

   
  * Stop being so boring.        

   
  * Don’t repeat yourself.
