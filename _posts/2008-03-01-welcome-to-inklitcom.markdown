Inklit is a blog about writing as a career. It has just come into the world like any newborn, slick and helpless and stupid about what it will become. As though struggling for oxygen, it's the wrong shade of blue.

 

Inklit was born at 11:00 AM on Saturday, March 1st, 2008.

 

I had an idea about my writing career, and my idea gave Inklit life. I already have a career as a professional writer of sorts. I am a blogger, pimping used houses to the search engines. This pays the bills, but all by itself it's not very satisfying. So I thought I would enjoy doing more with my writing career and my life. With this idea, I began to write some stories.

 

The idea that I would share what I learn about writing as a career gave Inklit life.

 

Maybe you haven't made any money writing yet. Or maybe like me you've done some writing as a career, and now you want to get better at your writing work, and explore new formats and new markets.

 

That's what this blog is about. Welcome.
