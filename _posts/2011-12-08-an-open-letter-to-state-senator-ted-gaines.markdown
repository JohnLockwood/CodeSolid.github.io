As I wrote to your colleague in the State Assembly, Dr. Richard Pan, I have recently moved into your district from El Dorado County and will be updating my voter registration shortly.  I was able to confirm with your office that I am a constituent of yours.

I would like to call your attention to, and earnestly request your support for, a matter which we hope will be before the State Senate in 2012, State Assembly bill [AB-1148](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_1101-1150/ab_1148_bill_20110426_amended_asm_v98.html).  This is a bill to improve the reporting requirements on political mailers and commercials, so that the voting public is aware of the real supporters of legislation.  As you're aware, at present we are presented with choices that look something like "Concerned Citizens for the Cuteness of Babies" and "Patriotic Grandmothers Against Illegal Activity" when the real supporters of legislation and political races are hidden from view.

To give a concrete example, [Chevron spent some $3.75M ](http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/10/prop-26-prop-23-californi/)in California to support Proposition 26, a ballot measure that was also heavily financed by Philip Morris.  This is hardly surprising, since it restricted our ability to impose fees on those who harm the public to those measures that could garner a 2/3 vote.  Meantime, the supporter of Proposition 26 was listed as: "Stop Hidden Taxes—No on 25/Yes on 26, a coalition of taxpayers, small businesses,  environmental experts, good government  groups, minorities, farmers, and vineyards."

This is legal fraud, pure and simple.  As an insurance man, I'm sure you know that if an insurance agent in your employ were to sell a policy based on the sort of deceptive practices embodied here, his license (and likely yours) would be put at some risk.

This bill has the support of conservatives and liberals alike, polling as supported by 86% of Democrats, 78% of Republicans, and a whopping 88% of independents.  This too is not surprising.  Honesty and transparency in government are neither conservative nor liberal issues -- they are issues of morality and functioning citizenship.

I submit to you that what's at issue here is not whether your support regulation (to which, in general, I see you are opposed), but whether you support it to the extent of being willing to defend flagrant crony capitalism and lying to your constituents.

As I mentioned, I recently wrote [a similar message](http://www.particlewave.com/2011/12/05/dr-richard-pan-state-assemblyman-an-open-letter/) to Dr. Richard Pan, and I have not yet heard from him.  You might take this opportunity to show that as a Republican you can nevertheless beat a Democrat to the punch by taking a principled stand against crony capitalism.   I look forward to hearing your positive response so that I may share it with my readers.

Thank you very much,
