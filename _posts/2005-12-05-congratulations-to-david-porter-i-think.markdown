I wanted to congratulate David Porter for being hailed as a [Small Business Communications Pioneer](http://blog.pacesettermortgage.com/2005/11/pacesetter_mort_2.html).  David's a good guy and a blog roll partner, and I enjoy his work quite a bit, since I don't really think anyone's doing as well as a blogger in the mortgage field.  Since I may be getting into the finance end of the business more and more myself once my license upgrade happens, and since I'm an avid blogger now, obviously that's of interest.

The reason for the "Congratulations ... (I think)" in the title is something that lurks in David's post and that's been on my mind as well.  When he talks about his audience, David mentions that his audience from his own clientele is small, but he's appealing to a national readership.  I wonder if he's talking about the same sort of sales disconnect that I mention in my [You Ain't Goin' Nowhere](http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events/2005/you-aint-goin-nowhere_114.html) post.

I had a serious comment from someone in the internet marketing field that the point of a blog was not to generate traffic or leads, but to become a "thought leader".  Meantime I also heard from a nice young lady writing an article on real estate blogging.  She was trying to find someone who used blogs as a lead generation tool, and hadn't been able to find anyone.

Well, duh.

But then, if it isn't, what am I doing here?

So don't get me wrong, David Porter's still a swell guy, and there's nothing wrong with being a small business communications pioneer.   Heck, I wish someone would hail me as one of those.   But if it were my mortgage blog, I know what I'd want.  Five or ten more loans.

So we'll see.  One of the things I'll be trying out on my [Sacramento Blog](http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events/2005/sacramento-relocation-and-school-information_122.html) is to pick some topics of interest to some of my traditional "strong buyer" clients.  Of course, you can read between the lines of that post, too.  If most of my clients are actually from around here, why is my strength in sales so much in relocation?  (Actually, I partly know the answer to that -- it's because people here often already have a RealtorÂ® here, whereas relocation clients are "ours to lose").
