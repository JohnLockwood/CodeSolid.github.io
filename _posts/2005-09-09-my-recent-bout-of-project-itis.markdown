How many web sites does it take to get to the chewey Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop? This is the non-musical question I've been asking myself lately.




I like Fridays because I use them to plan out the week ahead, though this Friday I am primarily looking back at the undone to-do list of the week behind.




Let's look on the bright side. [Elk-Grove-Home.com](http://www.elk-grove-home.com) made it into Yahoo's directory this past week. The "bad news" of course, is that catching up on my competitor's 1137 MSN links creates a project that is so ten minutes ago in its technique, yet high in cash value.




Then there's resurrecting this blog. Project for no money.




Converting this blog and the [Sacramento Real Estate Blog](http://www.sacramento-home.com/real-estate-events/) to Wordpress (project), and [the cure](http://wiki.wordpress.org/?pagename=RadioUserlandImport) is worse than the disease. There's also no money in this, but in the case of the Sacramento Real Estate offering, there's at least the "post to the future" feature that I can't live without.




Get RosevilleHomesAndLand into Yahoo. Join the MLS in East Bay. Links plus Yahoo plus yada yada yada and write two posts a day and a whole slew of local interest pages for [Oakland-Homes-For-Sale](http://www.oakland-homes-for-sale.com). Project Project Yada Yada Project.




Create a nifty real estate [content aggregator](http://www.seochat.com/c/a/Yahoo-Optimization-Help/An-Insiders-Secret-To-Seriously-High-Rankings-With-Yahoo/2/) of some of the real estate blogs in the world, and use this as the starting point for one of the real estate directories, the domain names for which are rattling around.




Start meditating again. Bad Buddhist.
