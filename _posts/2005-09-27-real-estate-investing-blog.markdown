[Bigger Pockets](http://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog) has a blog tied to their nicely done site.  I thought they did a good job from what poking around I did with their investment calculators.  I was thinking about doing something like that ever since I picked up [Frank Gallinelli's Book](http://realdata.com/index.html) on real estate investing financial measures.


	

But you can't take on every project, and one would think that with two blogs and ten real estate sites or so I'd consider myself well project-ized already


	

Of course, one would also think that if I'm going to be linking to books, I should also go set up an Amazon affiliate account so twenty-eight years from now I can claim the $100 I got coming to me.


	

I need to give one a call later and find out how he's doing.
