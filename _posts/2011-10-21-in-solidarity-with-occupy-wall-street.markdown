I've been following [Occupy Wall Street](http://occupywallst.org/) with great interest on Twitter, and last Saturday Jenniffer and I went down to [Occupy Sacramento](http://www.meetup.com/occupytogether/Sacramento-CA/) for a time to meet the folks and show our support.

Although Occupy Wall Street finally makes it worthwhile to be on Twitter, I thought it was time to write a little more than 140 characters about what a wonderful thing the movement is and how much I enjoyed my brief time meeting with the folks in Sacramento.  To be honest, it's hard to put into words what a wonderful feeling it was to be there.

During the Bush era, I was positively embarrassed to be an American.  When the bailouts came in 2008, I left the real estate business I'd been building for several years to go back to work as a computer programmer.   I remember hearing about statistics that went something like this (sorry if this is a bit imprecise, but it's from memory):   Of 2,000 calls to one of our California Senators (I forget which one), all but six of them were opposed to the bailout.  So public opposition was something like 99.7%.

The Senator voted for the bailout.

Any illusions about our government being "representative" that I might have been foolish enough to hold onto before that time were shattered by that news.

Until Occupy Wall Street came along, I had no idea what to do about it.  Moreover, I certainly wasn't trying, because I didn't even think anyone _could_ do anything about it.

Now I am full of hope for the future, and respect for the people of this movement.  They have shown me that there is something that I can do -- that we all can do.  They have reminded me of the words of the Declaration of Independence, that:


> Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.


I hereby withdraw my consent.

Are we on the eve of a second American Revolution?  Who can say?  I for one don't think the corporate state will give up its prerogatives willingly, but perhaps I underestimate the power of non-violent movements to wield influence.

It's not that I know where all of this will end up.  But for the first time in my memory I believe the answer might be something other than hell-in-a-hand-basket.

Stay strong.  I love you guys.
