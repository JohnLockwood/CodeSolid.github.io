I just spent a few hours fussing with some of the really old stuff from this site.  There were actually two or three good articles down there, buried under some more recent nonsense written in JSP.  Pretty soon we'll finally yank out the Tomcat server and that should be the last JSP I'm running anywhere.

ParticleWave used to be a sort of Etch-A-Sketch that I'd erase and draw lines on from time to time between software contracts.  Ever since I got out of full time software contracting, it's been a subject in search of a subject matter, all revved up with no place to go.  It's like riding a square wheeled tricycle.
