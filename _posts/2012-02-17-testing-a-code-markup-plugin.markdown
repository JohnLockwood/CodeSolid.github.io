I just installed the [Code Markup Plugin](http://thunderguy.com/semicolon/wordpress/code-markup-wordpress-plugin/) and thought I'd give it a bit of a test drive.  Some HTML and PHP ought to be enough to prove the concept, I would think:


    
    
    [code lang="php"]
    <html>
       <body>
          
       </body>
    </html>
    [/code]
