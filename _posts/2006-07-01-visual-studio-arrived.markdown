Well, my copy of Visual Studio arrived, and it's installing now.  This should make hacking around in C sharp a bit more intuitive, and certainly it makes ASP.NET development a heck of a lot easier than it would have been otherwise.  Looks like fourth of July weekend will be given over at least in part to some major hacking, if it isn't Memorial Day by the time the installer finishes.   The package also included an exam voucher for the [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0â€”Application Development Foundation](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp), which I was planning to take anyway.  Pretty cool.

And heck, thinks are looking up.  We're on CD 2 already.   Of course, I remember Borland C++ on 21 floppies...
