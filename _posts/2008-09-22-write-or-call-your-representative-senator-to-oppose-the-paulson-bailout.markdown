I don't know how much you're following the news of the bailout of wall street banks who repackaged bad loans, but if you're not, now is a great time to get involved and please, please call your elected representative and tell everyone you can about this incredible fiasco.

Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and George Bush are asking Congress for the authority to spend up to **$700 billion** at a time (that's a balance sheet maximum, not a maximum on the total the government can spend). That's more than the [total cost of the War in Iraq](http://zfacts.com/p/447.html) so far. The Treasury will spend it buying bad loans, and get no equity stake in the firms they're buying them from -- leading some to call it "cash for trash".

Section eight of the proposed legislation gives Paulson an oversight-free blank check as to how to spend that much of your money.

> Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.

You can read the [full text here](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?ref=business).

Although as you might expect, public opposition to the plan is strongest among Democrats, several prominent conservatives have also [gone on record](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html) as being opposed to the plan. This legislation is so bad that [even CNN gets it](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/22/paulson/index.html). 

Please look up and either write to or phone your [Senator](http://www.senate.gov/) and [House Representative](http://www.house.gov/house/MemStateSearch.shtml) right away. You can learn more about the proposal by clicking through on the articles current on Digg for [Business and Finance](http://digg.com/business_finance).

Congress is in a HUGE RUSH to get this done, so those of us who think it's expensive, ill conceived and leaves us stuck holding the bill need to MOVE NOW to express our concerns to Congress.

**UPDATE:**  
  
Here is the [latest draft the bill](http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html), which I must admit I think is substantially better than Paulson's original proposal. I wouldn't go so far as to say this makes me for the bill, but at least it's moving in the right direction.
