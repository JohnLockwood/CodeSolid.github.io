As <strike>threatened</strike>, [promised](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/03/promote-your-real-estate-blog-on-housseecom/), I've added a sidebar widget for the top user links to [Houssee.com](http://www.houssee.com/), the Internet's best 100% Spam-free (famous last words) Pligg-based real estate publish-and-vote-for-your-news Digg clone.

How come only Jay Thompson and I are top users? Short answer, because only Jay and I are the intrepid first adopter and admin, respectively, who submitted one or more stories and added a URL to our profile.

For those of you who are interested in the hitherto unpublished details of the Brain-Dead-Algorithm (tm) -- subject to change without notice, but not too soon -- here it is:

Did you enter a URL in your profile? Did you submit at least one story? If so, you're totally the golden-boy (-girl) with a front page link. When there get to be > 6 of us, the people with URLs who've submitted the most stories will be the Top Users.

Being a Houssee.com top user will increase your geek credentials tremendously, though not as much as rolling your own Linux install or coding with a soldering iron.

Submit early. Vote often. Enjoy!
