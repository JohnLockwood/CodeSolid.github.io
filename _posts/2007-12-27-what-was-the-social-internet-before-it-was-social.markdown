Do you remember the anti-social Internet, where nothing was connected to anything and no one communicated using it?

Neither do I.

From its outset, the Internet has been about people sharing and communicating information and ideas.  In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee first conceived of a hypertext project at CERN as a means for researchers information.  In August of 1991 the first web site was put online at CERN, and we've been all typing up a storm ever since.  In addition to web sites and the tools to browse them, the first killer app of the Internet was e-mail.

In addition to email and web sites, electronic bulletin board systems (BBSs) like the ones I frequented on Fidonet in the eighties were, as the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) correctly points out, a precursor to the World Wide Web.  You could say that we had a social Internet before we had an Internet, and the latter was just a bunch of protocols to run it on.

**Enter The Web 2.0 Now Here's Something We Hope You'll Really Like Social Internet**

For the last few years a lot of people have been spending a great deal of time on various social networking sites.  In 2006, Myspace allegedly reached the 100 million user mark -- a number that at least one geek has [debunked](http://forevergeek.com/articles/debunking_the_myspace_myth_of_100_million_users.php).  The popular real estate social networking site, ActiveRain,  also launched in 2006, and many agents and brokers including me have invested (squandered?) a great deal of time there.  More recently, I've been amazed by how many messages I have whenever I log in at Facebook or Cre8Buzz or one of the other social networks I've participated in -- and I'm not really that popular a guy.  Ann Cummings invites me to use FunWall.  David Smith pokes me.  Oliver Muoto received a can of Whoop Ass.

Poor guy.

For awhile there I was getting email daily updates from Facebook, telling me the most inane things

I turned that off eventually.

**Seven Criticisms of the Social Internet**



	
  1. **It's Amateur, in the sense that you don't get paid for it.
**[Andrew Keen](http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/) has probably written more about this criticism than anyone.  As a corollary, I agree with this argument, insofar as I've made a decent living off of several web sites I've created and maintained, but no money at all off of ActiveRain.  Even the referrals I've received have not come from ActiveRain, but from people finding my own web sites.

	
  2. **Someone's might be getting paid for it, but it won't be you.
**One of the most amusing incidents in Move.com's failed acquisition of ActiveRain was this ActiveRain apologia about [who owns the content on ActiveRain](http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/).  Still, I don't recall any discussion about how the thirty-million would have been shared if the transaction went through.  Oh.  See also, this article about [remodeling the kitchen in a house you rent](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/10/creating-your-own-internet-real-estate/).

	
  3. **It's Amateur, in the sense of incompetent or unskilled
**Think:  Myspace web pages.  Pink on purple, anyone?

	
  4. **It's Amateur, in the sense of trivial or unimportant
**OK, this one's almost built in.  In order to socialize, human beings have to lighten up a bit on their seriousness.  Still, it does seem to me that one can base an adult friendship on banter a bit more sophisticated than throwing sheep at one another.

	
  5. **You Can't Optimize for Every Web Site There Is
**Every web site has its own rules for getting to a top ranked listing.  I prefer to shoot for the top of Google, Yahoo, and MSN in that order.  These are sites that buyers and sellers use when they're buying and selling, not socializing.  Yes, this means I've had to give up my coveted #2 spot on ActiveRain.  So far I haven't noticed a difference.

	
  6. **It's Anonymous**
Having their cake and eating it too, social Internet socialites believing in the absolute sanctity of open information (thou shalt not ever censor me), even if they don't sign their names or take responsibility for their actions.  Human-Powered Search Engine Mahalo goes a step further and recommends that instead of a photo of your human self, you "Be Cool" and use a Wee-Me Avatar instead.  Apparently being Human-Powered wasn't cool enough in its own right.

	
  7. **It Confuses Grouchiness with Erudition
**With a hat tip to [Quote of the Day](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Vicomte_de_Chateaubriand/) and the Vicomte de Chateaubriand (famous consumer of steak), "You Are Not superior just because you see the world in an odious light".  And yes, I do apply that criticism to myself as well, and see this as one of my less useful posts.  I can never get enough of the [Internet Commenter Business Meeting](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1771556).  To be sure, that's not new, either.  We had the same sort of thing going on in Fidonet.  To puree a metaphor, there's something about sitting behind a keyboard without a real face in front of you that makes it harder to wag your tail.
