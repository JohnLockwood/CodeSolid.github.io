I'm pleased to announce that I'm currently beginning work on a blog installation and training program for for Peter Thompson, a [Chicago Loan Officer](http://www.ptmortgage.com/ng.html). Peter and I met through a comment I made on ActiveRain and we hit it off right away, because I was able to provide him with a low cost and personalized set of services to:

  * Improve the Search Engine Optimization of his existing web site.
  * Research effective key words to use for his web site and blog.
  * Install a Wordpress blog based on a standard template, with some customization to the template.
  * Suggest strategies for blogging topics, attracting more visitors (both customers and colleagues that can contribute to the blog's success), etc.

Based on some of the writing I've seen from him both on his newly launched site and his [Active Rain blog](http://activerain.com/blogs/pt1111) and his "in it for the long haul" attitude, I expect that it won't be long before his new blog will ultimately serve as a major resource for Illinois home finance information.
