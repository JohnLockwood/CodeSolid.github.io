Happy Friday.

I don't usually go for confessional blogs myself, so I usually try not to write like mine is one.  You know the genre.  They usually have a tagline that starts with "Just", to qualify their author's efforts.  "Just my thoughts on the war", for example, or "Just the ramblings of a chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan".

However, sometimes I live up to my own standards so poorly that I would make a great Republican.  So this is just a happy Friday post, depending on the kindness of strangers, living behind the music store.  It is just a confessional post, with the following confessions:



	
  * I love how easy it is to self publish online, because it means there are lots of opportunities.

	
  * I hate how easy it is to self publish online, because it means that every chain smoking pregnant teenager living with her boyfriend behind a music store in Taiwan is in competition with me.

	
  * I also hate how easy it is to publish online because I can get confused about which of my projects are important.  Given the terrible, self-imposed imperative to become awesomely popular and the number of chain smoking pregnant teenagers I'm competing with, I feel like I have to come up with a definitive domain / topic / killer app within the next few days or I'll die penniless, with my young nemeses selling my clothes for cigarette money.


Now you know why I hate confessional blogs.

In the interest of replacing this funk with some creative work, I'm going to shift gears now and work on one of those projects.  If you see any teens catching up with me, for God's sake, won't you please let them know how bad smoking is for the baby?
