I recently left this idea on the [Call for an Alternative Day of Mass Action](http://www.occupytogether.org/2011/11/19/call-for-an-alternative-day-of-action-on-human-rights-day-saturday-december-10th-2011/) post on Occupy Togetherâ€™s web site.

 

While signs and uniforms are interesting visuals that appeal to those who already agree with us, I think it would help grow the movement tremendously if we were always seen acting in Gandhian non-violence and love toward the poor and downtrodden whom we profess to care about. So, for example, carrying a sign -- OK. Carrying a sign (or not) while volunteering in a food kitchen or a free clinic -- awesome.

 

The problem with "we are the 99% and we want our student loans and mortgages forgiven" is that the portion of 99% who don't yet agree with us (about 40-ish % at last count) can see through our thin anti-corporatism to find what they see in corporations underneath -- self-interested economic war.

 

Well, "they've waged class war on us all these years" -- though correct historically -- begs the question. Violence on their part returned by violence on ours diminishes us as individuals while it limits our growth as a movement.

 

Uniforms and signs and other advertising gimmicks are nothing that Corporations don't already own in spades. Active and consistent acts of kindness and love toward those less fortunate than ourselves are things that will benefit us both personally and as a mass movement.
