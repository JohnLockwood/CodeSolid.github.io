“_When people are free to do as they please, the usually imitate each other.”_

 

**-- Eric Hoffer**

 

Last time I wrote about finding my life’s purpose, and since then I’ve spent more time reading el señor optimista, Anthony Robbins, and working through some of his exercises. As with many self-help books, there comes a point where you list your goals, and the author starts with great ideas like making millions and flying private jets. By this point, I usually feel compelled to write something in the millions, but I must say, I’ve had difficulty in the past tying this goal to my values, since I don’t think that wealth _per se _is really high on my list.

 

Listing values, of course, is yet another Tony Robbins exercise, along with going on a mental diet. Yes, I am currently on one, on day two, thanks.

 

I haven’t listed my values yet. I think it might be helpful to do so in the context of first writing about…

 

### The Missing Exercise

 

Maybe this exercise is missing from Tony Robbins’ book, or maybe I skipped over it, but because I consider myself to be in the design phase of my life and my future business, I am going to list some role models for my business. These are possible prototypes, or approaches to designing a set of business goals that are consistent with my values. I should point out that though it’s missing in my reading to date, the exercise is implicit in Tony’s ongoing study of successful people.

 

So here without further ado are several role models I am looking at, for one reason or another. I suspect the goal that I fashion once the design phase is finished and I move on to implementation will be a mixture of one or more of these approaches:

 

  
  * **Tony Robbins**         
Well, if it’s not obvious already, this Tony Robbins is having an impact on me. Yes, I know, he does fire walking at his seminars. Nobody’s perfect. 
   
  * **37 Signals**         
Legend (or their book) has it that these eight or so developers have generated a huge amount of cash for themselves, some $24.00 per month of which came from my real estate business, [Elite Properties](http://www.sacramento-home.com). The model here is to write several simple but elegant Application Service Provider applications in Ruby on Rails. Great model. Great language. What a hoot. 
   
  * **Application Service Providers in General**         
It’s unfortunate that Microsoft’s Active Server Pages has the same acronym as Application Service Providers, because as role models go, ASP is not one of them. ASP is just some technology that one may or may not highlight on a resume. In this article, ASP stands for Application Service Providers (which are genuinely exciting as a business model) not Active Server Pages (which at best are interesting). 
   
  * **Top Producer and SettlementRoom**         
Top Producer began as a desktop application (or perhaps pre-desktop), devoted to helping Realtors® manage their business. Their application itself was uselessly ponderous as of the last time I tried it, which often happens with fat clients hastily ported to the web. As far as I know Settlement began as an ASP providing escrow management. One idea on which I worked part time for several weeks was an application which split the difference between these two real estate applications, while trying to emulate the simplicity of 37 Signals apps. 
   
  * **ICanLocalize.com**         
These folks provide general localization and translation services, a model which appeals to my new-found passion for languages. They combine this with web site design and development in Drupal and Wordpress. How cool is that? For you, maybe not at all. For me, _¡es muy chevere!_
   
  * **Hulihan Applications**         
I just found this site today, and was impressed by the owner’s approach of creating several lightweight Common License applications, apparently to serve as the loss leader to his web development and design business. This is another Ruby on Rails shop, but the service oriented, open source approach here is very, very different from that of 37 Signals. The choices the author made for applications was also of interest, as was seeing them in use on his site and thinking about how one might design something similar. 
   
  * **Ronin Tech Collective**         
I wrote about this [employee owned software company](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/11/01/knee-jerk-open-source-ialism/) back in November. An employee owned company is great if you place a high value on contributing to the success of others within your organization, or if you watch too many Michael Moore movies. 
 

### Questions for the Future

 

  
  * Who are [the Warriors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV4cgs-bPic)? There must be some word! 
   
  * What do my choices of attractive companies tell me about my values? What can I learn by listing my favorites? 
   
  * How can I use this to design a more exciting plan? 
   
  * Can any shorter term goals be generated from these exercises?
