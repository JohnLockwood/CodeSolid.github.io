Looking in Wordpress on the self-imposed categories I can choose from, "Random Particles" makes perfect sense for this one.   If I've understood what this post is about by the end of it, I'll be happy, since at present I certainly don't.  It's an attempt to pull some cohesiveness from multiple disparate mental threads, an imposition of some sort of order into what is essentially cohesive and chaotic.

On the one hand it's about software battles.  My LeadReply project is going well, suffering only from distractions like the one that prompted this post.  But the spec that's a scant three weeks old and it's emphasis on providing the market some sort of .NET demonstration is already feeling outdated, like John Lockwood 1.0.  But that's the platform, after all, and if Ruby on Rails is as cool as touted, I can always take whatever year I put into LeadReply and redo it in a month if that's what I feel like doing.

And in part it's about the distractions from this project.  I'm doing some major reworking of my Oakland site -- and probably will do so here as well, to get it ready to "monetize" it.  What a concept.  One major ParticleWave thread from the beginning has been learning about making money on the Internet.  Now that I've finally actually done that through some successful real estate sites, I envision being able to do more of it for some of my less productive "Internet Properties".

In part it has nothing to do with any of this business of busy-ness, but about the wonderful Dharma of Patrul Rinpoche, who I'm reading now.  One of the central truths that emerges from the book is the importance of meditating on impermanence.  That is to say, neither ParticleWave nor my other sites are unlikely to survive into the next century, and it's certain that _I_ won't survive into the next century.  Nor is it even guaranteed I'll make it until five o'clock.

Some motivational cat -- Richard Robbins?  someone else? -- posed the rhetorical question, "What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?"  Buddhism a la Rinpoche stands the question on its head, yet with an even more liberating result:  "What will you do now that you are certain to fail (die)?"

With the vastness of suffering and death, how can we be anything but kind?
