Are you a freelance writer who's looking to do paid reviews?   Should you do them or should you avoid them?

Paid reviews have become very popular (or perhaps infamous), as bloggers offer them on their own blogs and as services like [PayPerPost](http://payperpost.com/), [Blogvertise](http://www.blogsvertise.com), and [ReviewMe](http://www.reviewme.com) start trying to capitalize by connecting advertisers and writers.

Yet paid reviews are not without their problems.  Should the fact that a review is paid be disclosed, in much the same way that you see "PAID ADVERTISEMENT" disclaimers in printed magazine articles?   Can doing a paid review get you in trouble with the search engines, and if so, how can you minimize the problem?  Are paid reviews viable to do for advertisers?  Are they profitable for bloggers?  If they're not profitable, can we make them more profitable?  If you do write paid reviews, do you have to agree with your client's position?

Over the next several days I will be writing several articles about paid reviews to examine these issues and more.

**Readers, What Do You Think?**

Do you offer paid reviews?  Have they been a good source of revenue to you?  Are you opposed for ideological reasons?  Opposed for practical reasons?
