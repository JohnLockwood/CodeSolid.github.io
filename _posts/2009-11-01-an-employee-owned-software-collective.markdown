I met a few out of town friends to see Michael Moore’s Capitalism, a Love Story recently. As usual, Howard Zinn loving socialist that I am, listener to this guy that I am …

 

 

this movie was quite appealing to me, and I began to think about how cool it would be to work for an employee owned software collective.

 

So that's what I'm going to do.

 

How hard can it be?

 

Oh, right, it can be an arduous part time struggle to get the thing going while woikin' for the man every night and day. But I never lost a minute of sleepin', worrying 'bout the way things might have been.

 

Oh, sorry, that's a different song, isn't it?

 

**Further Reading**

 

Anyway, here are a couple of resources if this idea appeals to you as it does to me:

 

The guys actually have an [employee owned software collective](http://www.ronincollective.com) in the liberal Ben and Jerry's Gay Marriage state of Vermont. A collective, no less. Let's hope Papa Joe Stalin doesn't come by and wipe them out.

 

Isn't socialism exciting?

 

I enjoy it.

 

The more detail oriented among you may enjoy this (PDF Alert) article about [What Is an Employee Cooperative](http://www.community-wealth.org/_pdfs/articles-publications/coops/article-logue.pdf)?

 

There’s even a [bit of a club](http://www.usworker.coop/front) we can join. Kind of a Star Trek Economics Chamber of Commerce. 

 

Let’s just hope I’m not the ensign in the red shirt.

 

Kaplah, comrades!
