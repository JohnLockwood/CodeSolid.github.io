Today I went to my State Assembly representative's web site and sent him the following letter.  I hope to receive a positive response from him so I can post it here.

Dear Dr. Pan,

I recently moved to Orangevale from El Dorado County, and will be changing my voter registration within a few days to reflect that I am a constituent.

I would like to call your most earnest attention to AB-1148, The California Disclose Act, a bill that I enthusiastically support (along with 86% of Democrats, 78% of Republicans, and a whopping 88% of independents).  I recently joined CAClean as a volunteer Working Group leader, and intend to do everything I can including petition drives, etc. to bring awareness to this issue in your district.  Naturally, if you would work toward and support this popular, moral, and utterly uncontroversial legislation, you will not only be doing the citizens of your district a valuable service, but I will personally do all I can to let the voters know that you have pledged your support to get money out of politics.

I do not know you personally, and have every reason to believe you to be an honest and hardworking public servant.  As a Physician and educator, I'm sure you've been frustrated with the way that insurance and drug companies are calling the shots and tying your professional hands, to the detriment of the health of your patients.  Moreover, as a clean money candidate, I believe you stand to gain huge popular wins for as long as you may wish to serve, and I will commit to doing everything I can between now and your next election to make sure that happens, by letting that 84% of your Democratic base and as many of the 88% of independents as possible know that you are a true servant of the public good.

The popularity of the Occupy Movement is a testament to how frustrated the electorate is with money in politics, and I believe your support of this bill will be a huge populist win.

It's time to get the money out of politics.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience that I can count on your  support, so I can look forward to toasting your health at your 2012 victory party.

Sincerely,

John Lockwood
