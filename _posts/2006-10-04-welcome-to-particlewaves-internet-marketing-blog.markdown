Hi,

John Lockwood here.  I've been saying for some time now that I need to get some more focus to this web site, and now it's finally kicking off with the launch of my real estate Internet marketing blog.  The purpose of this blog will be to serve as a major resource for information about making money on the Internet, with a special focus on how Real Estate professionals can use all the tools that technology has to offer to improve their business.  We'll have a new interface in a day or so, and start moving content over from our personal blog, then we'll start adding what we hope you'll find are lots of great new articles.

So pull up an RSS reader and stay tuned!
