Many of our readers will recognize Dave Smith as the author of [The Real Estate Blog Lab](http://www.realestatebloglab.com), a very popular blog about Dave's experiments with using Wordpress.  Dave also runs several blogs for his wife, Barbara Lasky, including the [Tucson AZ Real Estate Blog](http://www.tucsonazrealestateblog.com) and [Tucson Real Estate In the News](http://www.barbaralasky.com/tucson-real-estate-blog).  Tucson Real Estate In the News has propelled BarbarLasky.com into a first page position on Google, while his other blog ranks equally well on MSN.  Answering my call for guest authors to write about their [Internet Marketing Strategy](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/01/08/whats-your-internet-marketing-strategy-authors-guide), Dave emailed me details on his real estate business.  These included some production statistics that Dave later asked me to delete; I hope Dave will forgive me if I let you in on the secret that they were excellent.

**Dave writes:**

About 85% of our business for 2007 came from our Internet marketing.  This is what I'm in charge of doing (you probably already had that one figured out).

2007 was our best year yet.  Barbara has been in the business full time now for six years.  I'm a newbie at just over two years, but was the database administrator for Long Realty Co. with more than 1500 agents in fifteen offices.  They have expanded since I left.

I don't know how many prospect/clients we are working with currently.  I know it is quite a few.  We have two sources of business.



	
  1. Past clients and referrals from them.

	
  2. The Internet marketing.


We have done more referrals this year than ever before.  We have two commercial deals closing this month with a 20% referral which will be somewhere around $2.3 million between the two of them.  These came from Internet leads from our blogs.

We do almost no print advertising except on our Sunday insert a few times a year.  No magazine or other media.  No mailings, nothing else except a small drip campaign:  once a month a post card goes out with a tip of some kind from Barbara's sharper agent account.
