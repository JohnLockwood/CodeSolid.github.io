Only a scant 3 1/2 years after I [first started writing](http://www.particlewave.com/2009/11/01/employee-owned-software-company/) about ParticleWave as an employee owned software company, yesterday I finally met with someone with enough desperation good sense to become employee owner #2. This is really exciting.

Our focus will be on Quality Assurance, especially test case automation using Selenium on Java and Ruby on Rails.

We have a lot of exciting work ahead of us, putting our sales contacts together, setting up the testing lab, building a brand and digging into the tools.

We're having another organizational meeting at 9:00 as a Google hangout. We'll be meeting weekly. If you're a developer / QA engineer or a client marketing focused staffing professional, we'd like to extend an invitation to attend a future meeting.
