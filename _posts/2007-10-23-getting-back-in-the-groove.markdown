Wow, it's hard to believe it, but it's been over a year since my last Internet Marketing Post.

This is not the way to run a successful blog.  I consider myself duly chastised.

It's interesting to me to note how October comes, and when October comes all the Realtors® start slowing down and writing e-book projects.  Last year I [threatened one](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2006/10/05/the-ebook-project/), but fortunately for Western Civilization the threat was a hollow one.

This year [Purva is working on one](http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com/2007/09/call-for-submissions.html).

**What happened to last year's e-book**

What happened to last year's e-book was that things actually got busy again after October.  In November and December, things had started to take off.  Then by about February, I'd pretty much forgotten that I was supposed to be growing a "new business" doing Internet marketing services for Realtors®.  I put "new business" in scare quotes because this is really my current business as well, it's just that in my current business, I do it for one customer, my own brokerage.

How well that's going is that I've been fortunate to enjoy #1 search results for some pretty important keyword combinations on major search engines.  Not just first page results, but top of the first page results.  I like those.

Your mileage may vary, but to my way of thinking there's just no reason to even get started on an Internet marketing campaign if you can't dominate a niche.  That's where you should be heading.  Your site should be generating leads for you.  If it's not, fix it or fire it.
