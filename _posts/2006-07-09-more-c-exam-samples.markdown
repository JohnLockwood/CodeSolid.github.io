I've uploaded the latest [Sample Code for Exam 70-536](http://www.particlewave.com/dot_net/MicrosoftCertificationExam70-536.php).  This batch includes the ICollection etc. samples posted last time as well as a few halting forays into ConfigurationManager -- there's more to do in that section, to be sure.

I'm not very happy with how the code formatting is going given the layout of the Particlewave site.  I just don't have enough room between the navigation and the right hand links to get a decent line of code in, it seems.  We'll have to look into that further, or give up the idea of blogging about code -- I don't like the latter alternative at all.
