As you all know, this is a new blog.  I do have some other blogs that I've been working on for some time -- the oldest since 2003.

Inklit is so brand new that we're still counting the articles here in single digits, and we have "archives" for March -- the month we're in now.

That's hardly a reputation yet, it's more like an indictment.  Yet things are moving along about the same as they always do on a brand new blog.  The [Feedburner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog) is done, and we're listed on MyBlogLog.  I was able to chat up Jennifer and get her to stop by.  That was nice.   Google has figured out that we exist and has started indexing us.

For the most part, though, nobody knows I'm here.

That's either good news or bad news, depending on your point of view.  As my wife pointed out a few days ago when I complained that I didn't quite have my subject matter in hand yet, the lack of readership means I can make all the mistakes I want.  A less charitable way to say it would be this:  It doesn't matter how much I suck, because no one's reading me anyway.

**When In Doubt, Change Your Mind**

Being new in a career is a sure fire way to experience a false start or two.  One of the things I remember about my first year in real estate was how many different directions I tried before things started to click for me.  There's a lot of that going on this blog and in my new writing career as well.  For example, the post that appeared here yesterday about [setting writing goals](http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/06/setting-writing-goals-making-room-for-the-good-stuff/) was one that I actually wrote a bit earlier.  Now it's Friday already, so it's time for me to think about how it went this week, catch up on the unfinished tasks, and maybe report back.

OK, then, well here's my report, oh ye who are not yet reading me!

As far as production goes, my blogging production on my various blogs is at about 80% of the goal I set for myself, and I should have it up to 90% or better by the end of the day.

The fiction goals I set for myself, which in my earlier post I said was "the good stuff" I was making room for, is the one area where I have a big fat goose egg to report.  The opportunity that drove me emotionally and that also consumed most of the time this week was the PLR writing goal.  I spent well over the allotted ten hours on this goal working on setting up a shopping cart system, in the course of which I scraped my knees a few times and found out about three or four different ways that the shopping cart won't work.  Originally I'd been promising my writing partner that I'd have the cart up and running by Monday, but it's looking like it'll slip.

In miscellaneous news, I did a creditable job of keeping track of my time for the most part, though I still find I have to force myself to set my timer before I set out writing.  My output varies between about six and fifteen words per minute -- I'm using 10 as a rough idea of what I can produce.

I do think the idea of setting the goals in writing for the week was worth doing -- and setting them somewhat aggressively was also the right approach.
