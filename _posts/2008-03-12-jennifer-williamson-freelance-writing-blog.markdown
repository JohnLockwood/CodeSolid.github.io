Jennifer Williamson is the proprietor of Catalyst Writing Services, and author one of the first blogs about [freelance writing](http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com) that I bumped into online.  After a few articles, I was hooked and added her to my feed reader right away.  The first thing that stood out immediately about Jennifer's blog was the quality of the writing and thinking she put into both her posts and her comments.  Jennifer's blog is one of the few blogs that I've not only subscribed but have also started "reading backwards".  Her post about [PLR writing](http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/plr-legitimate-business-model-or.html) inspired a later post of mine, and her [writing scams](http://catalystblogger.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-post-should-be-simple-and-easy-if.html) article was also a treat.  Jennifer's blog also has a well maintained and current blog roll that helped me get started on my own resource section and begin learning who my betters are.

And as if that isn't enough, Jennifer Williamson also has the distinction of being the first person to ever make bold to write a comment here on Inklit, before anyone knew that writing comments here would become a major Internet pastime.
