We have a new featured question over on the ASPWorkbench.

 

Here it is:     
     
Which of the following are differences between XML Serialization and standard serialization? Check all that apply.      
     
A) XML Serialization allows both public and private data members to be serialized, while standard serialization supports only public data.

 

B) Only standard serialization uses the [Serializable] attribute to determine if a class is serializable.

 

C) Using the BinaryFormatter class along with standard serialization allows for more runtime efficiency than XML Serialization.

 

D) Standard serialization does not support the SOAP protocol.

 

For the answer, head over to the Workbench while this is still the [featured question](http://www.aspworkbench.com/blog/). (I know, that’s a bit of a cheesy process, but I just haven’t yet had time to get the archives and the site registration going – coming soon though).
