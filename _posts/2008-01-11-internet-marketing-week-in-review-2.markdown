This week I found lots of lists of more reading to do. It's amazing how a few hours with populating a good feed reader with great feeds can quickly pile up to more reading than you can possibly keep up with.

 

**Build Quality Links       
**You may have heard that along with great content, good quality incoming links are essential to a successful search engine optimization campaign. There are dozens of ways to go about this, and Sergey Rusak, an SEO specialist in Boston, has published an excellent list to get you started in his article, [52 Ways to Get Quality Links](http://www.techwebmedia.com/2008/01/04/52-ways-to-get-quality-link). (I think English is Sergey's second language -- nevertheless the resources collected there are awesome). For that article, we have a hat tip to [Lorelle on Wordpress](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/sobcon-be-there-for-the-business-of-blogging) (and by the way, though we may not be attending SOBCon -- I've found Lorelle's blog to be always worth a trip). Remember when embarking on a link building strategy to always keep in mind [Google's Webmaster Guidelines](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769) and their page on [Link Schemes](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=66356).

 

**Brushing Up Your SEO       
**Writing for the Online Marketing Blog, Lee Odden covered the winners in Search Engine Journal's [Search Engine Marketing Blog Awards](http://www.toprankblog.com/2008/01/best-search-marketing-blogs-2007/).

 

**Social Networking Software       
**Those of you who found my [critique of Ning.com](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/04/reductio-ad-myspace) to be a bit over the top and who are looking for a serious review of some social networking software solutions may want to check out this review of [Ning, Kickapps and other social networking software](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/9-ways-to-build-your-own-social-network/). After John Jantsch stopped by last week I saw he was running a social network on Kickapps, so I stopped by there to give it a spin. So far I've found Ning to be a bit more robust.

 

**Real Estate FAQ       
**As he always does, Phoenix Real Estate guy Jay Thompson has done a good job implementing a real estate marketing idea that you sometimes see surfacing on other sites, the [Real Estate FAQ](http://www.phoenixrealestateguy.com/latest-blogsperiment-the-real-estate-faq/626). Such in depth real estate coverage may help you with "long tail" search results, and help to establish your expertise to your clients and your site's relevance to the search engines.
