This week we look at some of the resources that can help make you a better blogger.

Lately I've been finding that a lot of the best tips can be found on the general blogging sites, rather than on the sites about real estate blogging and the usual real estate social networks.

An excellent starting point for example is Darren Rowse's series [Blogging Tips for Beginners](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/14/blogging-for-beginners-2/).

Another excellent resource for blogging advice is the [Daily Blog Tips](http://www.dailyblogtips.com) site, which has a very high ratio of posts that actually are, go figure, daily blog tips.

My favorite resource from the point of view of improving your blog writing is the [CopyBlogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/) blog, which focuses on blogging as a special case of ad copy writing.
