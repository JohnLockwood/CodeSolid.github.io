The cops arrived at dawn from fifteen jurisdictions

 

They roused the terrible rabble (who they later charged with camping)

 

Firing tear gas on men, women, and children

 

The latest in crowd control

 

They shot Scott Olsen in the head 

 

They shot Scott Olsen in the head

 

And fractured his skull

 

 

Enough cops

 

Enough jurisdictions

 

How many Scott Olsens will get shot in the head for camping?

 

While Fox News lies about ACORN

 

Support the troops

 

How much will you believe?

 

How much is enough?

 

 

How many jobs will you send overseas

 

To cook your numbers this quarter?

 

How many black lies told by how many white men and 

 

First black presidents?

 

Don’t tax the job creators

 

Pay no attention while we sign these trade agreements

 

Colombia, South Korea, Panama

 

 

Your free trade isn’t free

 

You can’t have protectionism without protecting something

 

What could it be that isn’t free that you could be protecting?

 

Somebody’s job

 

Somebody you’ll shoot in the head

 

for camping

 

Instead of protecting his job.

 

How much is enough?

 

 

How much of our money

 

Will get robbed in the next election

 

While FOX lies about ACORN

 

Whle FOX lies about anti-semitism

 

While FOX lies in the stomach of America

 

like leftover food for fools left to rot

 

While fat cats float flat tax

 

While you smug in your private community

 

While you swung your nine irons

 

While you pasted new phones on your loneliness

 

 

How many processors do you need

 

For a phone

 

To watch FOX lie?

 

To lie on your back or 

 

In your teeth

 

Or come, ye 99ers

 

To the next how many rallies

 

to be shot in how many heads

 

by how many cops

 

from how many jurisdictions?

 

 

The sun is rising

 

On America shot in the face

 

The sun is rising too

 

because we’re here

 

together

 

in solidarity

 

asking 

 

how much is enough?
