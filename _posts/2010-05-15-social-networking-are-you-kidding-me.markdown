Well, leave it to [Andrew Rhee](http://www.andrewrhee.net/), my very smart friend, to finally teach me what social network marketing is about.

 

The problem I had in understanding social network marketing was that when I first encountered it, it was as a Realtor, and most of my colleagues were just setting up pages like “Podunk Real Estate” and asking me to be fans. This struck me as rather self serving and not very interesting.

 

Andrew straightened me out the other day by telling me that he rarely goes on Google except to find information, but when a friend recommends something (on Twitter, for example), he often is very interested. Oh, yeah, I get that! That’s plain old vanilla referral marketing, only with a web site as a telephone.

 

Bear with me: I’m old.

 

So anyway, I’m going to start fooling around more with integrating social network content into my sites. That would be in between making drastic changes to my life, working, learning Spanish, and going to the gym.

 

Well, at least I’m not bored.

 

So this post serves to announce that intention to my legions of raving fans. Oh, right. As well, it’s a test post, since I’ve just set up TwitterFeeds to Twitter and the MyFace, aka Facebook.

 

Let’s see if I can read myself there by writing myself here.
