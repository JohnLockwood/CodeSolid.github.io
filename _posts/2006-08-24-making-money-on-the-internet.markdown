In my last post, I hinted that ParticleWave has been about making money on the Internet all along.

As Gavin DeGraw summed it up, "I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately."  And I might add, whatever that is, the mind has a propensity to declare that that's been what it's been all along.

Meantime over on my Oakland Blog, I hit the zone this morning with a post about how much [I love Walmart](http://www.oakland-homes-for-sale.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/24/the-enterprise-of-blogging/).  You might also call that post, "Confessions of an Interloper" -- but if you do that, you waste a perfectly good title.

You know us interlopers:  We always wonder about what's in the title tag.  That's how you get to be an interloper.

So how do you make money on the Internet?  It's  simple, get yourself a domain, like ParticleWave, and then fool around with it in every moment of your spare time for a couple of years until you know something.  Then go off in a totally different direction, i.e., real estate, and have a head-slapping moment when you realize that some other guy in the office is being paid to be an internet interloper.  (Or internetloper, as one might say).  Then realize, "Hey, you can make money on the Internets in Real Estate?  Sweet!  I'll try that approach."

Alternatively, you can stumble into some other way to do.  If you do, that's great.  I hope I do, to.  Actually, I don't plan to stumble.  I plan to learn, and to teach, and to succeed.

Why not.  What else have I got going on?

I will say this, though.  When I see some other articles about how easy and overnight it is, however, I want to cringe.  For me, it's been hundreds of hours of work, lots of false starts, hits and misses.  Even now, I can't say that my Internet revenue is such a big deal that I can afford to give up my "brick and mortar" activities.  Not that I really use brick and mortar on anything, but that's the idiom.
