RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication", and it allows you to subscribe to blogs and news sites you like so you'll be able to read them whenever they get updated, without having to go check the site to see if there's anything new. You do this using an RSS reader, which can either be a web site type reader or software that you install on your computer.

 

When people say "subscribing", they simply means adding a site to a reader. Often you can just enter the address of the blog itself into the reader, and it will figure out where the "RSS feed" is. An RSS feed is just a web page in special format that an RSS reader can read. Most blogs have a subscribe link like the one on my blog, and that link is taking you to the RSS feed itself.

 

On this blog that link looks like this:

If you click on this link, you'll have the option of subscribing in a reader if you already have an RSS reader account set up somewhere. But what if you don't? Well, let's try one on, shall we? It won't take long.

 

**Introduction to Google Reader**

 

Let's keep it simple and look at one popular RSS reader, Google's Reader, which is at [http://www.google.com/reader](http://www.google.com/reader). If you have a Google account (Gmail email address), you should have access to this already. If you don't, click the big blue create an account button and get your free Google account, then when you login you should go straight to the reader. (If not, use the link above again).

 

When you enter Google Reader for the first time there's a short video you can watch if you want, then you'll want to start adding subscriptions. You should see an "Add Subscription" link on the left hand side of the screen. (Tip: if you don't see it, look for a gray arrow on the left that will make the left hand navigation window visible).

 

The button should look like this:

Click the "Add subscription" link and you'll see a place where you can add the web address for the blog or feed you want to add. (Remember, behind the scenes you're always adding an "RSS feed", but most blogs are set up so that if you just add a page or the home page from the blog, it'll work.) So just copy the web address of the blog you want to add here.

 

To add this blog, for example, enter [http://www.inklit.com/blog/](http://www.inklit.com/blog/) and then hit the add button:

You're almost there. You won't necessarily see anything yet, but if you look at the upper left hand corner of the page, you'll see a link called "Home" right below the Google Reader Icon:

Click that home link and you'll see that the recent articles for the blog you just added now show up. It'll look something like this.

**Why Should I Go To All This Trouble Just To Read This Blog?**

 

Well, if my blog is the only blog you read, you shouldn't go to all this trouble. You should just come here and read it. Oh, and by the way, thank you, thank you, thank you for your rapt attention. I really appreciate it!.

 

No, as compelling as I am (ahem), the chances are you read lots of different blogs and news sites that are updated regularly, and when you read such sites, you want a way to be able to just go to one place and see what's new. Readers like Google Reader let you go to a single place and read all the news you want to read, and nothing you don't, without having to manually visit each blog to find out what's new about the topics of interest to you.

 

**Now What?**

 

Now that you've got your reader set up, your world gets a lot easier. If we visit another web site and click on the subscribe here link, we can add that site as well. Let's say you're over at CatalystBlogger, for example, and you click on Jennifer's "Subscribe Here" link. You'll end up at [her feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Catalystblogger). You'll see a bunch of buttons on the right hand side, and if you click the Google button you can add her right into Google Reader easily. Next time you add a feed, you may find a single link that says "Subscribe with Google", since FeedBurner (the site where many of these RSS feeds live) will remember that you like to use Google Reader.

 

So now go find your favorite blogs and enjoy reading them! And if you haven't done so in the tutorial above already, thank you for adding [the feed for Inklit.com](http://feeds.feedburner.com/InklitcomWritingBlog) to your reader.
