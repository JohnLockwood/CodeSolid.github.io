Q.  How many computer programmers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

A.  None, that's hardware.

Well, I finally broke down and decided that it was time to get off this minimalist sales guy laptop I'm using and get some real development hardware in here.  After all, I have to go play API alphabet soup on job interviews, so I want to make sure I can tell an SOA from a POJO.  So I ordered a nice development machine from HP, and it should be here in a couple of weeks -- hopefully less.

Talking to a friend from my VSP / Synergex days today, looks like I can still hold my own fairly well on the technobabble.  But there are a number of things I never tried out, back in the day, and a few things that have either developed or appeared since.  Time to start hacking again -- hooray!

And by the way, apropos the acronyms, the fact that now we have an acronym for the Plain Old Java Objects we should have been coding in all along is fairly amusing.  Unfortunately I'm still seeing statements of work for the Dark Side of the Force -- EJBs, of course -- so it's a little to early to make a stand on the virtue of simplicity.
