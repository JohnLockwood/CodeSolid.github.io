I just merged some tasks from Ellen Gummesson's cool Rake Boilerplate, and once that was done, started this post based on nothing
more complex than 'rake["Testing the Rake Post Task"]'.

Very cool.  Nice job, Ellen, and thanks.

My Rakefile with David Ensinger's work on building Jekyll sites locally and working around the fact that Github doesn't support most plugins, together with some of Ellen's post-creating magic is located [here](https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.io/blob/source/Rakefile).
