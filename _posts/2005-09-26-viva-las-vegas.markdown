Now maybe it's just me, but having such a nice [Las Vegas Real Estate Blog](http://www.mslasvegasrealestate.com/blogs/) and not titling it Viva Las Vegas is a bit of a missed opportunity.


	

Everybody loves Elvis.


	

But anyway, Michelle Sterling does a nice job otherwise.  Too bad about the IRS and poor Wayne Newton.


	

I'd love to see more detailed market information.  I've become a bit of a detailed market information junkie.  Of course, the critical reader will note that I've yet to join the MLS and publish any detailed real estate information in this market, though I do alright for [Elk Grove](http://www.elk-grove-home.com) and [Roseville](http://www.rosevillehomesandland.com).


	

Normally I jump in with both feet a lot faster than this, but lately I just want to free up some capital.
