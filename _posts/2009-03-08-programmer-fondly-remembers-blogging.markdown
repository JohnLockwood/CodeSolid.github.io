Do you remember blogging?

I think when the history of the current economic depression is written, historians are likely to draw a parallel between the bloggers of 2007 (or thereabouts) and the flappers of the roaring twenties.

Do you remember blogging? Do you remember having the money to blog? That brings me to my next point: what happened to me, and why am I not blogging any more? The short answer to that is that the money started to go away, so I went and got me a day job.

You know: a day job, with a boss and a 401K and a W2 at the end of the year. Yikes!

I'm a fortunate man to not be unemployed right now. I'm fortunate because I'm self-employed when times are good and -- so far at least, knock keyboard -- I have a day job when times are bad. In my day job I'm back to my old day job of programming software using Microsoft's Visual Studio. As it happens, the software I'm working on in my day job is a legacy C and C++ Windows codebase. I maintain the database layer, which at times is a proprietary collection of drivers accessing Oracle, ODBC, etc., and at times is just an OLEDB connection.

On the weekends, when I'm not spending ten minutes with my family, I'm working on creating some vertical applications using more recent Microsoft technologies, ASP.NET 3.5, C Sharp 3.0, and LINQ to SQL. One might say, to paraphrase Michael Steele, that I'm bringing my core programming values and applying them to "[urban-suburban hip-hop settings](http://blacksnob.com/snob_blog/2009/3/6/michael-steele-ends-hip-hop-urban-to-suburban-campaign.html)."

I have a Republican friend at work. Some of my best friends are Republicans. Does saying that make me a racist?

I apologize that I don't have more code to share here yet. I'm too busy writing code to have much time to write about writing code, but I do remember blogging.
