The ASP.NET contract I'm doing in Sac is going quite well so far.  It's a small and really congenial team, and in less than a week I started to make some good progress on some of the code.

There are some minor hiccups -- development anti-patterns, if you will -- but it doesn't look like anything too dire.  Some of this involves existing code written by a now-missing contractor,  which is always a delicate matter.  Everyone likes the guy and he's clearly very sharp in his work, but some of the underlying framework of his that we're coding too may have a bit of architectural gold plating (which is not so bad in itself except in insofar as it may violate the Pragmatic "DRY" rule).  A little more of a concern is that it may drive our efforts in the wrong direction as far as being fat / difficult to fix (which IS so bad in itself).  Must learn more...

But that's just code, which can always be fixed or tossed.  The really tough job -- good management and a team that gets along well -- is already in place.  Without that no amount of code will save you anyway.

Also, being in Visual Studio again is a treat.  It's always had a fairly competent debugger -- and let's face it, as a programmer, that's home.  I keep a SlickEdit window open for the heavy editorial lifting, of course.  The new SourceSafe integration is flawless so far, too, and that's quite nice.  I'm starting to get a pretty good feel for ASP.NET.
