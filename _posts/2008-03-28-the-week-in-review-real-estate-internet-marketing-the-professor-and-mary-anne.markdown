This has been a busy week. I was very gratified to get Dave Smith to come by and take part in our new series, [What's Your Internet Marketing Strategy](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/03/24/real-estate-blog-labs-dave-smith-on-his-real-estate-internet-marketing-strategy/), and Dave was a big enough draw that subscriptions went up quite a bit after his article. I've started making inquiries of some exciting new authors. If you have people you'd like to see, drop me a comment.

 

Over on Sacramento-Home.com, I had to play fix-the-code-that-Metrolist-broke after our local MLS changed its database structure. I've been able to put together quite a few interesting web site features using a combination of MLS exports, a MySQL database, and some PHP programming. The neat thing about such work is that you can offer your users some really custom content and search options, and I've found this goes over really well. In spite of all the hype about blogging, home shoppers aren't looking for a pundit -- they're looking for a house. The down side is that every year or so you need to spend a day or two fixing code, but for the benefit, it's certainly worth the time.

 

Everyone is hanging around on Twitter this week. A few weeks ago everyone was hanging out on FaceBook. As social networks go, you have to like Twitter, because once you've set up TwitterFeed to blab at your friends for you, you don't actually have to spend any time blabbing at them yourself. Well, there I go being a Luddite again. If you want to try your hand at using Twitter to promote your blog, check out [Chris Brogan's](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/) [guest post on ProBlogger](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/03/25/how-i-use-twitter-to-promote-my-blog/). That's much better. I'll have to do resource post on Chris over at Inklit -- he's got some great stuff going on over there.
