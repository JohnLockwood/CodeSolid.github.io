We've written about landing page optimization before. Traditionally, folks running a pay per click campaign were very interested in making sure they're converting as many visitors as possible. However, even if you're blogging, you should not ignore the fact that you are, at the end of the day, working to make a sale, not just to have your head appear on as many social networks as possible (though we'll get to that in a minute, too). This week we uncovered the article, [Ten Tips for Lead Generation Landing Pages](http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/09/ten-tips-for-lead-generation-landing-pages/), which is especially relevant to real estate marketing.

With the recent changes in the Google [page rank](http://www.soloseo.com/tools/indexRank.html) of many major web sites, many people are wondering if there are other indicators of a web site's importance that are somehow "better" than PR. One of the tools I came across this week in this context was Solo SEO's [IndexRank tool](http://www.soloseo.com/tools/indexRank.html). IndexRank is a measure of how fast a site is growing, based on how many pages are indexed over a period of time.

I [wrote about Ning](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/04/reductio-ad-myspace/) earlier in the week, taking a bit of a critical view of the idea of a social network for everything, everyone. Later in the week however I had to hurry up and head over to Cre8Buzz after getting a nice invitation from Metrowest's [Bill Gassett](http://activerain.com/blogs/metrowesthomes), one of our first active readers here on ParticleWave. Let me pass that invitation along to all you real estate professionals, come [sign up at Cre8Buzz](http://www.cre8buzz.com/real_estate/signup_now).

Now that you're done buzzing, get ready to learn about Web Analytics and SEO. Analytics is the subject of Justin Cutroni's excellent blog focusing on Google Web Analytics, [Analytics Talk](http://www.epikone.com/blog/). On the SEO front, Original Signal has put together the RSS feeds for several outstanding SEO sites into a single resource, [Broadcasting SEO](http://seo.originalsignal.com/).

And finally, you may need some pretty pictures for your blog. I personally like the big selection of photos that are more or less a buck at IStockphoto.com, but when it absolutely positively has to be free, check out these [public domain photos](http://www.public-domain-photos.com/) and this list of [free / cheap photo web sites](http://pstutorialsblog.com/44/free-stock-photos/).
