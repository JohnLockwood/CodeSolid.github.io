excerpt: "I'm happy to report good grades and the beginnings of a good foundation in R Programming and Data Science with two certificates I earned from the Johns Hopkins / Coursera 
program in April.  Working on another course this month, too!"

In May I'm working through the course "Getting and Cleaning Data", but the grades are in for April.  I was able to get two certificates for taking the courses below 
concurrently.  I'm also happy to report that I did quite well in both courses.  

I do think the Johns Hopkins / Coursera program has a lot to recommend it, not the least of which is a fairly rigorous grounding in R.
