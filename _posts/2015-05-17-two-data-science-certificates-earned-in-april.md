excerpt: "I'm happy to report good grades and the beginnings of a good foundation in R Programming and Data Science with two certificates I earned from the Johns Hopkins / Coursera 
program in April.  Working on another course this month, too!"

In May I'm working through the course "Getting and Cleaning Data", but already in April I was able to get two certificates for taking the two courses below 
concurrently.  I got a 100% grade in each course, too.  I'm not sure I can maintain that since Getting and Cleaning Data threw me a curve ball or two,
but I'm hoping to still pass that one with distinction as well.  Good times for an ex University A-Junkie turned Mooc A-Junkie.  But on a more substantive 
note, I do think the Johns Hopkins / Coursera program has a lot to recommend it, not the least of which is a fairly rigorous grounding in R.
