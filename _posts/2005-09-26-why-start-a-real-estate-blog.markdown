We've just added a new article, [Why Start a Real Estate Blog](http://www.particlewave.com/WhyStartABlog.php), our opening article in what will become "Real Estate Blogging 101".

Before we got into the how-to of using a blog to improve your real estate business, promoting your blog, and the like, we thought it was a good idea to get to the heart of the matter by trying to answer the most basic question:  why bother?  And it's a fair question indeed, if you're a RealtorÂ® who's strapped for time and wondering why you should devote a half hour or more per day to sitting down at a keyboard.  We give you two of the best reasons in the article -- and we didn't even get into the whole business of establishing yourself as an expert in a local area.   Somehow that whole "market positioning" angle seems a bit theoretical to us, whereas traffic is a more tangible benefit.
