IDX stands for "Internet Data Exchange", and is also called Broker Reciprocity.  Simply put, it is a technology that enables individual real estate agents and brokers to host listing data on their web sites, and to receive the leads generated when users inquire about listings.

IDX has been around for several years.  The idea is that brokers and agents should enable other MLS participants to display aggregated listing information on their web sites. Indeed, the National Association or Realtors Policy Statement says that brokers must make this information available to other members of their MLS, unless the broker explicitly opts out.

As written in the NAR policy statement (please check with Realtor.org for the latest version), "Associations of REALTORS and their Multiple Listing Services are encouraged to immediately, and must by January 1, 2002, enable MLS Participants to display on Participants' public website aggregated MLS active listing information through, at Participants' option, either downloading and placing the data on Participants' public access web site or by framing such information on the MLS or Association public access web site (if such a site is available) subject to the requirements of state law and regulation."

In a nutshell, that means that NAR recognizes that the informed consumer wants to see listing data when they go to a Realtor's web site, and they want to make this information available to all Realtors to publish on their web sites -- even those agents who work with buyers exclusively.
