Instead of wondering who won the Houssee award this week, I've spent the last few days playing spam cop. In the hope of not having to do this too often, here's an unfortunate reminder from our law enforcement division.

On the issue of vote manipulation, as our [spam policy](http://www.houssee.com/spam.php) states:

> **...if your friend is just you by another name, or if you and your friend have secretly agreed to promote everything for each other regardless of the quality, that crosses the line and becomes spam. Your published posts may sent back to the upcoming queue, or if you persist, your posts or account may be deleted.**

A few users spent quite a bit of time testing out this policy this week, and have discovered that it works. For those of you who didn't test it out, thank you, and yes I do hate being a cop probably as much as you hate reading about me being one.
