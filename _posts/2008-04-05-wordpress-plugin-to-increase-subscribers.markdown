When I wrote my [101 Subscribers in 30 Days](http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/) post, [Minnesota Investment Property](http://www.minnesotainvestmentrealestate.com/) specialist Scott Ficek was good enough to comment on on the post and recommend the "What Would Seth Godin Do" plugin, so I could get a nice-sized subscriber base like the one shown at right.

So, thank you to Scott and I hope he's right that this plugin works well, lest I have my clothes sold off by [pregnant teenage chain smokers](http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/04/04/so-many-blogs-so-little-blogger/).

(No, that's not a bid to go after some of the wrong kind of traffic, but I'll bet I get it anyway.)

While I appreciate Scott's participation and suggestion, I must admit that I almost didn't make it past the name on this plugin.

I realize that people who need someone to follow are stoned in love with the bald one, but many of us could care less what Seth Godin would do.  I would have called it the "New Visitor Welcome Plugin" or the "Convert New Visitors to Subscribers" plugin.  That way when people are wondering how to convert new visitors, they'd find the plugin.  But that's just me.  I appreciate Richard Miller writing it, and if you're going to contribute good code to the community I guess you can pick whatever name you want.  Meantime those of us who've largely forsaken programming for writing can just shut up about it and [link to the plugin, already](http://www.richardkmiller.com/blog/wordpress-plugin-what-would-seth-godin-do), by way of saying thank you.

Thanks and a hat tip again to Scott.
