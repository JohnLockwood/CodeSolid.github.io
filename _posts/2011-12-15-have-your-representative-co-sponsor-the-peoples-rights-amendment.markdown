I got a very good email yesterday from [Free Speech for People](http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/) summarizing some of the progress we're making against corporate personhood, encouraging me to ask my representative to co-sponsor the People's Rights Amendment house resolution, which overturns Citizens United.  (Read the resolution in [PDF format](http://www.freespeechforpeople.com/sites/default/files/Peoples%20Rights%20Amendment.pdf)).  Here's the suggestion, which I've followed (and urge you to do the same).  It took me about 3 minutes.


> Dial **[202-225-3121](tel:202-225-3121)**, or **[202-224-3121](tel:202-224-3121)** (either one should work), to reach the U.S. Capitol switchboard.  Give the operator your zip code and ask to speak to your Representative (not your Senators).  
  
Once you’re connected, let the staff know you’re a constituent, then ask your Rep. to **co-sponsor** the **People’s Rights Amendment -- H J Res 88**.
