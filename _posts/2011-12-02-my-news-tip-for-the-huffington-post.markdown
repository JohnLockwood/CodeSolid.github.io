I sent the following news tip today to the Huffington Post. Please add your voice to mine to ask them to cover it. This is huge.


> Please, please, please cover this story. It is hugely important for our nation:

An anonymous author has written a document / petition called "The New Common Sense", which is being circulated among Occupy folks (see for example) [http://www.occupyoakland.org/2011/11/the-new-common-sense](http://www.occupyoakland.org/2011/11/the-new-common-sense) or the online petition at [https://www.change.org/petitions/the-new-common-sense ](https://www.change.org/petitions/the-new-common-sense)(There's a version at whitehouse.gov too but it is completely unusual).

Although perhaps originating with Occupy, far from being a leftist screed, it is a call for a return to a government that is responsible for preserving and defending the Constitution (duh). Progressive Radio host Thom Hartman calls it awesome and brilliant and I agree.
