I've been digging a little more into Ruby, and I definitely get what the excitement is about.  As a few authors have said, Ruby strikes one as [Perl done right](http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/xml_matters_18.html).   I loved PERL, even when it was done wrong, so needless to say I'm really having a blast in Ruby.

If you havent done so yet, I'd encourage you to go up to the [Ruby Web Site](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), download Ruby, and check out the Prgagmatic Programmer's [Ruby Book](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html) for a great free introduction.

I'm currently working on automating my real estate business using [Ruby Mail](http://www.lickey.com/rubymail/), and wanted to thank Xinizul for his excellent [fix for Rubymail on Windows](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2597&group_id=426&atid=1698), which saved me several hours in the debugger.
