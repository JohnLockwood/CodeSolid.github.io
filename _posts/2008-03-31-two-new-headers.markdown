Hey, isn't this blog supposed to be about writing?  How did these design elements get here?

I like the second one better.  It looks better if you click it to see it full size.

My wife likes the current look and feel better than that one, though.  There's something about the whole black and white that must be a guy thing.

Readers, what do you think?
