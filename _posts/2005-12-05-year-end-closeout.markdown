I feel like I should run a year end closeout of crazy web ideas from this past year, to make room for all the crazy web ideas I'm having now.

One slated project I hope to implement in 2006 is some free web site content for RealtorsÂ®.  I'll have more about that as I do it.  This will consist at first of free articles you can download and install on your site, with a small link back to me at the bottom that will "pay" for the article.  Over time I may also host some free contact forms, but there's a bit more software development I'd need to do to make that happen.

We'll have more about this as it develops.
