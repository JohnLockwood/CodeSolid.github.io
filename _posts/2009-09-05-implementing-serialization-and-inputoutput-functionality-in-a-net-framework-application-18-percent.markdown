  *       

Serialize or deserialize an object or an object graph by using runtime serialization techniques.

       

May include but is not limited to: Serialization interfaces; Serialization attributes; SerializationEntry structure and SerializationInfo class; ObjectManager class; Formatter class, FormatterConverter class, and FormatterServices class; StreamingContext structure            


      
   
  *       

Control the serialization of an object into XML format by using the System.Xml.Serialization namespace.

       

May include but is not limited to: Serialize and deserialize objects into XML format by using the XmlSerializer class; Control serialization by using serialization attributes; Implement XML serialization interfaces to provide custom formatting for XML serialization; Delegates and event handlers provided by the System.Xml.Serialization namespace            


    
   
  *       

Implement custom serialization formatting by using the Serialization Formatter classes.

       

May include but is not limited to: SoapFormatter; BinaryFormatter class            


    
   
  *       

Access files and folders by using the File System classes.

       

May include but is not limited to: File class and FileInfo class; Directory class and DirectoryInfo class; DriveInfo class and DriveType enumeration; FileSystemInfo class and FileSystemWatcher class; Path class; ErrorEventArgs class and ErrorEventHandler delegate; RenamedEventArgs class and RenamedEventHandler delegate            


    
   
  *       

Manage byte streams by using Stream classes.

       

May include but is not limited to: FileStream class; Stream Class (NOT Readers and Writer classes, as they are separate objectives); MemoryStream class; BufferedStream class            


    
   
  *       

Manage .NET Framework application data by using Reader and Writer classes.

       

May include but is not limited to: StringReader class and StringWriter class; TextReader class and TextWriter class; StreamReader class and StreamWriter class; BinaryReader class and BinaryWriter class            


    
   
  *       

Compress or decompress stream information in a .NET Framework application and improve the security of application data by using isolated storage.

       

May include but is not limited to: IsolatedStorageFile class; IsolatedStorageFileStream class; DeflateStream class; GZipStream class
