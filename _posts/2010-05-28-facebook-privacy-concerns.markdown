Lately the well publicized quitting of Facebook by many Google empoyees and others over privacy issues has struck me as rather funny. OK, exactly what state secrets do you have on Facebook that would be a huge problem if someone found out? You like the movie Avatar? You play basketball? Yep, I could get your bank account information easily with that data. Your name? Make one up if you're paranoid. Your birthday? Likewise.

 

Look: the whole point of a web site like Facebook is to share a bunch of meaningless details with friends and people for whom the bar to being your friend is their desire to have a high number of friends.
