Today I began looking at A. B. Curtiss' book, "Depression is a Choice", which you can also get a feel for from Curtiss' [web site](http://www.depressionisachoice.com).

I've only sampled the first few pages to date, but the writing style is clear and direct, and the ideas compelling.  Needless to say, the thesis is a bit of a controversial one, and given that I'm just getting into it and therefore not intending to review it just yet, let me just link to a [more competent review](http://mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?id=779&type=book&cn=5) and counterpoint by Curtiss herself.  Actually I think that reviewer, though more thorough than me, is less probably less sympathetic than I would tend to be, but read on!




















My synopsis of Curtiss' argument  is that people can think whatever they want to, and by directing one's thinking away from depression, one can short-circuit its otherwise intractable hold on one's mood.  This works because the mind can only focus on one object at a time.  This certainly explains the strong effect I noticed when setting some goals, not only working concretely with the neocortex, but working concretely with the neocortex on something that is the opposite of the whole cognitive enterprise of depression.

Where depression denies choice over one's reality, goal setting is an activity that -- if anything -- overstates one's choice over one's reality.  One of the important caveats that the author of Mindtools' [Personal Goal Setting](http://www.mindtools.com/page6.html) article gives us is not to focus on goals that are directly attainable and subject to our own choice (within certain preconditions like not dying today and the like, presumably):



> Set performance goals, not outcome goals: You should take care to set goals over which you have as much control as possible. There is nothing more dispiriting than failing to achieve a personal goal for reasons beyond your control. These could be bad business environments, poor judging, bad weather, injury, or just plain bad luck. If you base your goals on personal performance, then you can keep control over the achievement of your goals and draw satisfaction from them.



The choice to direct the mind away from depression is an action, albeit one on a mental level.  Goal setting takes place with pen and paper, or software, so it is actively directing one away from a focus on depression.  However, I do think that an important component of the whole process is making achievable and therefore reinforcing progress on small goals.  There we have more action!

David D. Burns, M.D., in "The Feeling Good Handbook" (see above -- this material is circa page 170 in my edition) discusses motivation and action in terms of a virtuous cycle.  You don't get motivated by willing motivation, you get motivated by some small action.  The action then gives you motivation, and then you can take more action, and so forth.
