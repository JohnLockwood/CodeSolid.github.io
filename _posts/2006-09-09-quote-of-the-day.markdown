"It's been my policy to view the Internet not as an 'information highway,' but as an electronic asylum filled with babbling loonies." -Mike Royko, as quoted on [Instructional Resources for Chemistry Educators](http://www.chem1.com/chemed/flimflam.html).

So if you're reading this, whether you consider yourself Napoleon or Jesus, I welcome you.

I know you're not really either.  I know everything, because I'm god.

No, I'm not.  Had you going there for a minute, didn't I?

Anyway, bad jokes or not, sometimes I really do feel like this asylum atomosphere has a depressive influence.  I think that the ethernet packets are leaking, and some unhealthy miasms are getting me.

Stupid miasms.
