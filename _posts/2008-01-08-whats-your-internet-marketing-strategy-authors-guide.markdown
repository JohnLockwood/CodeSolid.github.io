Have you been successful in your real estate or lending career largely (or partially) because of your Internet marketing?   Our "What's Your Internet Marketing Strategy" series (see our [announcement](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/11/whats-your-internet-real-estate-marketing-strategy-a-new-series/)) highlights authors who are using the Internet to close more business.  You don't have to have an "Internet-only" marketing strategy or be a super top producer, but in general we'll try to focus on authors who are either so active now that their future success seems assured, or those who have a history of at least three or more closed escrows per year from their Internet marketing efforts.  Mainly what we're looking for in the series is a variety of different viewpoints.

Guest authors of course will have their own byline and appropriate links in their article.  (I recommend no more than five self-serving links, and no more than eight links overall).  If you're interested in contributing, please [contact me](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/contact/) and let's discuss it.

This article goes into some questions and guidelines that may be helpful to you as a guest author in our "What's Your Internet Marketing Strategy" series.  You don't have to answer any particular questions an certainly not all of them, but you may find that going over the list will help you to come up with ideas to round out your article:



	
  * How important is the Internet to your overall marketing plan?  Is it the only kind of marketing you do, or is it just one of many strategies?
