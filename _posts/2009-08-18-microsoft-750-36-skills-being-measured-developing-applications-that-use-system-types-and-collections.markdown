Developing applications that use system types and collections (15 percent)

As part of our student notes on the Microsoft 70-536 certification exam, we'll occasionally post portions of the [Microsoft outline](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-536&locale=en-us#tab2) here with links to our notes as we create them. Our first topic breaks down as follows:



	
  * 


Manage data in a .NET Framework application by using .NET Framework system types.




May include but is not limited to: [Value types](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/22/reference-types-versus-value-types/); [Nullable type](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/20/nullable-types-example/); [Reference types](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/22/reference-types-versus-value-types/); Attributes; Generic types; Exception classes; [Boxing and UnBoxing ](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/24/boxing-and-unboxing-in-non-generic-collections-versus-generic-collections/); TypeForwardedToAttribute class




	
  * 


Manage a group of associated data in a .NET Framework application by using collections.




May include but is not limited to: [ArrayList class](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/24/boxing-and-unboxing-in-non-generic-collections-versus-generic-collections/); Collection interfaces; Iterators; Hashtable class; CollectionBase class and ReadOnlyCollectionBase class; DictionaryBase class and DictionaryEntry class; Comparer class; Queue class; SortedList class; BitArray class; Stack class




	
  * 


Improve type safety and application performance in a .NET Framework application by using generic collections.




May include but is not limited to: Collection.Generic interfaces; Generic Dictionary; Generic Comparer class and Generic EqualityComparer class; Generic KeyValuePair structure; Generic List class, Generic List.Enumerator structure, and Generic SortedList class; Generic Queue class and Generic Queue.Enumerator structure; Generic SortedDictionary class; Generic LinkedList; Generic Stack class and Generic Stack.Enumerator structure




	
  * 


Manage data in a .NET Framework application by using specialized collections.




May include but is not limited to: Specialized String classes; Specialized Dictionary; Named collections; CollectionsUtil; BitVector32 structure and BitVector32.Section structure




	
  * 


Implement .NET Framework interfaces to cause components to comply with standard contracts.




May include but is not limited to: [IComparable interface](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/09/14/icomparable-example/); IDisposable interface; IConvertible interface; ICloneable interface; IEquatable interface; IFormattable interface




	
  * 


Control interactions between .NET Framework application components by using [events and delegates](http://www.particlewave.com/blog/2009/08/28/delegates-and-events/).




May include but is not limited to: Delegate class; EventArgs class; EventHandler delegates
