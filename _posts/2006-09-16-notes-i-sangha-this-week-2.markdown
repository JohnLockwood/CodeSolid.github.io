This was a good week in my Buddhist devleopment, inasmuch as I went out and met many more live two legged Buddhists than I have in the last year or more.  On Monday I was fortunate to drive somewhat quickly and arrive in time for the Dharma Practice and Teachings session at [Lions Roar Dharma Center](http://www.lionsroarmandala.org).  This Sangha was very friendly and welcoming and I enjoyed my visit.

On Tuesday I had a wonderful time sitting with a [sitting group in Placerville](http://www.mtstream.org/sittinggroups.html).  Chris Basiletti led a great Dharma talk after the meditation period, and there was a fun discussion afterwards that I enjoyed very much.  As if that weren't enough, we then took a break for tea, and our host provided some tea for us that seemed a lot like unconditioned tea to me.  OK, that's an exaggeration, I'm sure, but it was very good tea.

On Wednesday I didn't get to play with any Buddhist pals, because I was holding a house open with my good friend who is a Catholic loan officer, and only one inquisitive neighbor stopped by.  Now this doesn't sound entertaining, but it really was.

Thursday and Friday were days with a Y in them, too.
