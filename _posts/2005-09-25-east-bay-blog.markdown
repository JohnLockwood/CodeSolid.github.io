Can the East Bay support two great blogs (this one and another one)?  Why sure.  Proof of that is in the [Beast Blog](http://www.beastblog.com/), because East Bay is pig latin for Beast.


	

In addition to unravelling such intracacies of the language, the Beast Blog will let you in on what's happening in arts and culture in various neighborhoods.
