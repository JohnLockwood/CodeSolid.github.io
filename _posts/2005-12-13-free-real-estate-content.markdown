I've just started (barely) a new section on the site, the [Free Real Estate Content](/freecontent) pages.  Of course, there's no content there yet.  You get what you pay for.

No, no, just kidding.  The intent is that over time I'll be putting some original articles and pages there for general use.  The license is the only thing there now, but I'll be creating pages that RealtorsÂ® can use on their web sites.  Over time as well I may also get back into the software business, since I have a great web designer who wants to join me to work on real estate sites, so if you don't have the web site on which to put the content, we may have that covered, too.

As an intermediate step, what would be neat for the free content section (though it would take longer than simply putting up some articles) is to do some real estate forms in conjunction with the content.  In other words, lead generators.  Those actually aren't hard to do at all, I just have to work though making sure you don't get spammed via the form.

Anyway, our free real estate content is already free.  Now all it needs to do is grow up to be content.
