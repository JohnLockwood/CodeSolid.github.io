I am pleased to announce that ParticleWave has just launched [Houssee.com](http://www.houssee.com), a web site where you can submit and vote for your favorite real estate articles.

I launched Houssee.com because I enjoyed using RealEstateVoices.com, but as I mention in a [recent review](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/05/29/a-review-of-realestatevoicescom/), I felt it had a bit too much Spam to succeed in the long run.

The mission of Houssee.com is to be a promotional tool for Realtors®, mortgage brokers, and others in the real estate blogging community, while putting systems and strong moderation in place to keep out the spam. (What's the definition of spam? Well, it's everything that's not somehow directly related to real estate. Yes, Realtors® often have laptops, and the laptops often need batteries -- but your laptop battery ad is spam.)

As time goes on we'll have further announcements about Houssee.com and how you can make the most of it to help you get content read.

**Top Contributors Will Be Featured**

Within a few days I should have a section on the home page featuring the top six or so contributors. To encourage you to start publishing your stories, the "top contributor" will be the person who submits the most real estate stories, whether or not the stories are published. (As the site takes off I may reward other aspects of contributing, such as publishing stories that get good votes, or voting for others' stories, etc.)

If you have comments or suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment here.
