This week I finally published the video [Windows Live Writer Tutorial](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/12/20/windows-live-writer-tutorial/) that I've been meaning to do for some time.   This tutorial goes through getting up and running, but I didn't yet get into some of the really neat Live Writer features that would make you want to get up and running.  As a supplement to my tutorial in the meantime you might check out some of the other reviews and articles out there.  Phil Waineright's [Writer is Microsoft's first Live Killer App](http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=199) has an older (but still good) overview of the features -- and Live Writer now supports tags, which was missing when he wrote that post.  Paul Stamatiou also wrote an excellent [Live Writer Review](http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/08/14/review-windows-live-writer-beta/) with several screen shots based on the beta.  Paul also mentions a few of the drawbacks of the software that I hadn't noticed.  Finally, Michael Pick has produced an excellent [Windows Live Writer Video Review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY6gf5aa93E) -- which shows among other things that I need to work on my Camtasia to Youtube skills (no, I don't think I will link to my Youtube video -- that's the point).

Aside from Live Writer goodies, the other news is that it is almost Christmas, which means it's also almost New Years, so it's time to start thinking about things like business planning and goal setting.  There are only about two shopping days left to participate in DailyBlogTips's Group Writing Project, [2008 Blogging Goals](http://www.dailyblogtips.com/group-writing-project-2008-blogging-goals/).

Finally, I installed a new theme for this site earlier this week, ParticleWave_01, a custom theme I designed recently.  One of the items on what's getting to be a rather long ParticleWave "to do list" is to make a version of that theme available.
