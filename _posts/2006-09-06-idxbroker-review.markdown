Today I was working on the business plan for John Lockwood Associates, and thinking through how I would set up my IDX Broker site.  I've used IHomefinder for years for real estate agent sites and like them a lot, but I didn't think their broker sites would do what I wanted.

Along the way, I put a call in to the folks at [IDXBroker.com](http://www.idxbroker.com) and spoke to Chad, and Chad explained what his company does, which is some excellent integration work and design around IHomefinder sites -- the sort of thing ParticleWave would be doing if we were in that business, more than likely.  But what stood out from the conversation was how helpful Chad was and how much he enjoyed talking to folks about this technology.  In my case, he even turned me back on to IHomefinder.

Clearly, Chad's one of those great guys who puts his client's needs first, so I wanted to just put up that quick link above and let people know.  If you're a real estate agent or broker in need of an IDX web site, you owe it to yourself to give Chad a call and see what he can do for you!
