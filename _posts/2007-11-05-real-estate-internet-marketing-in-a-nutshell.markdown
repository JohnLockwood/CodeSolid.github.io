There is a lot of experimentation going on in Web 2.0 -- people trying out new things.  For the most part that's a good thing, but it can make the task of Internet marketing seem a bit dizzying.

If you read a few bloggers, especially, you'll develop a bizarre set of modernistic sounding marching orders.  You're told  you need to "find your voice" and "establish yourself as an expert" and develop a following of "raving fans" by being more "transparent" and taking part in a "social community".

If you feel like that's a bit too much to take, don't worry, so do I.  Let's see if we can simplify things a bit, shall we?

**If You Can Count To Two, You Can Be Successful**

To be successful at Internet marketing for real estate you need to do two things:

Thing 1) Get people who want to buy or sell real estate to find you.

Thing 2) Get people to buy or sell with you once they've found you.

I promise you, word of honor as a guy with a picture of a nut on his post:  that's all you need to do.

Sometimes I boil this down into a one line formula, SEO + IDX = $$$, but that only represents my favorite solutions to thing one and thing two.

Of course, the story gets a lot more interesting (and more complicated) when you start really looking into how to do things 1 and thing 2, but that's the basic formula.

Whenever I have spent time productively online, I was focused on one or both of these two things.

Whenever I have dropped the ball or wasted time or gone up a blind alley, the solution was to get focused back on one of these two things.
