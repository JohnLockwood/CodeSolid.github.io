Real Estate Internet Marketing Week In Review is a new weekly feature where I highlight either the authors and blogs and posts that I found interesting in my reading from the week past or that I thought Realtors® and real estate webmasters should know about.

My series on [Comparing Real Estate Blog Platforms](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/10/25/real-estate-blogging-platforms-compared-part-3) was a fairly general overview of real estate blogging options.  A more in depth review of specific blogging software is available in Problogger.net's [Choosing a Blog Platform](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/15/choosing-a-blog-platform/).

Thomas McMahon, writing for Toprank's Online Marketing Blog, prepared a handy introduction and [review of Google's Webmaster Tools](http://www.toprankblog.com/2007/10/google-webmaster-tools-review/), which is a free set of tools that helps you see your site as Google does.

Whether you're looking to extend your reach online, get free exposure for a listing, network with your peers, or what have you, an outstanding starting point is Oliver Muoto's list of [Web 2.0 Companies Realtors® Should Care About](http://www.vflyerblog.com/blog/2007/05/08/real-estate-20/).

My own marketing philosophy is summed up neatly in the equation SEO + IDX = $$$.  For those of you who think you have an online image that needs to be nurtured, however, Bobby Carroll has an interesting article on [Digital Brand Management](http://activerain.com/blogsview/248117/Digital-Brand-Management-Your).  Again, I offer this position not because I agree with it, but in spite of that.  PT Barnum is reported to have said "I don't care what they say about me as long as they spell my name right."  I might paraphrase:  "I don't care what _they_ say about me as long as my marketing is successful enough that you're reading what _I _say about me."

And now for something that I _do _agree with, Brad Carroll recently posted this [outstanding article](http://www.dakno.com/blog/thinking-about-requiring-users-to-sign-up/) on why you should not force your users to register before allowing them access to your IDX web site listings.  I've agreed with this opinion for years because of the money I've made specifically from people who told me not having to register was why they chose me.  Brad takes this a step further and explains the psychology and reasoning behind this.

Finally, my friends at Sellsius Real Estate [posted](http://blog.sellsiusrealestate.com/marketing-real-estate-agents/real-estate-transfer-taxes-for-every-state/2007/10/21/) this worthwhile blogging tip:


> If you are a real estate broker or agent, **do a post on closing costs**, with a breakdown of real estate transfer taxes, and estimated costs, and **put it permanently in the sidebar**. Every serious buyer or seller will click it. You betcha. It’s a good way to market your real estate expertise.
