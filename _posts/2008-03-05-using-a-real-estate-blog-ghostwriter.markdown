There's been a lot of hype around real estate blogging, and a lot of it is well deserved. Real estate blogging is a great way to promote yourself online, and it helps both human beings and the search engines come to know you over time. Do it often enough, consistently enough, and you almost can't go wrong.

 

If you read that last sentence carefully, however, you'll see that therein lies the problem with real estate blogging. "Often enough". "Consistently enough". Real estate blogging needs to be done repeatedly -- ideally once per day or more for a new blog especially, day in and day out -- to be successful. That's a pretty big investment in your own time. For those of us who are prone to writing addictions, we certainly don't mind the time invested -- that's what we do.

**Who Uses Real Estate Blog Ghostwriters?**

 

For others, there may be good reasons to occasionally or regularly seek the services of a ghostwriter to help in their real estate blogging efforts. A real estate blog ghost writer may be a viable solution in a number of different cases:

 

  
  * The real estate top producer looking to have a blog as one marketing piece among many, for whom blogging is a less productive use of time than being in front of clients. 
   
  * The brokers or team leader who wishes to use blogging as part of a larger strategy to drive traffic and leads to their web sites, but who prefer an investment of money over an investment of time to get this done. 
   
  * Real estate bloggers who want to have more content to use than they can reasonably produce themselves, in order to attract more readers than they could gather alone. 
   
  * Real estate agents or brokers who have a number of marketing ideas but who dislike writing or being "chained to their computer."
 

**Weighing the Pros and Cons**

 

The main advantage to using a ghostwriter is that you free up your time for other tasks. The main disadvantage, of course, is that you're negating one of the aspects of blogging that made it so cool to begin with: the ability to create real estate leads through a combination of sweat equity and verbosity.

 

Another thing to consider before hiring a ghostwriter is that in the short term, you'll probably get more "bang-for-the-buck" from a pay-per-click advertising campaign. Whether you write it yourself or hire someone to write it, the beauty of content is that it will be indexed for a long time, so although it may provide results more slowly and unreliably than a pay per click campaign, the results it does provide are more persistent.
