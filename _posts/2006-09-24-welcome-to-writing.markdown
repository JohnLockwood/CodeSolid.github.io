Today I add a new category: writing.   Hello, new category.  It's so easy to smile at such a friendly and welcome new visitor.

This first post in this friendly new category is also a bit of homework for a new book, "The Freelance Writer's Bible".  The point of the exercise was to go write something, as an illustration of how simple it is to get over writer's block.

I'm not so sure I have writer's block, per se.  I write all the time.  What I do wish to remove, however, are my remaining getting-paid-for-it blocks.

One might say that insofar as my real estate business is based on my successful web sites, and inasmuch as my web sites are successful because I write, that I'm also already a professional writer.

What a joy, then, this weekend, to discover that there's actually a business to be made of the activity of writing.

In my high school yearbook, I wrote down that my dream was to have one wife, one son, one dog, and one published novel.  As it turns out, I am fortunate to have a lovely wife, a wonderful daughter, two four-legged dogs, and no published novels.   Even to this day, having a novel seems a bit out there, something uncomprehended, a vague possiblity.   But it's less of a stretch for my impoverished imagination to get from a place where I blindly chase for search engine love with a mixed bag of sites both successful and fairly well free, to a place where I work on a business of writing for pay.  This journey strikes me as altogether entertaining and worthy of my time.

So best of luck to you, new category.  I sense the spark of greatness in you already, your potential to become the fulfillment of the goal I set recently, for this web site to be about something.
