Well, you can sure give it a try!

 

I've been having great fun working on my [101 Subscribers in 30 Days](http://www.inklit.com/blog/2008/03/11/eleven-steps-to-get-101-subscribers-to-your-new-blog-in-thirty-days/) promotion on my new Inklit Writing Blog.

 

A lot of people have stopped by and have helped me out tremendously as I work on the program. [Wasilla RealtorÂ®, Marty Van Diest](http://www.valleymarket.com/) came by and lit a fire under me that I know needed lighting, to allow email subscribers as well as RSS subscribers.

 

In a matter not so much related to getting 101 new subscribers in 30 days as it is to overall gratitude, [Authentic Real Estate Engagement](http://www.4realz.net) expert, Dustin Luther, stopped by a couple of weeks ago to help me out on another issue that I needed some help with. I appreciated his visit and the support. You should check out Dustin's blog if you're a real estate agent / broker interested in taking full advantage of Web 2.0.

 

**Win a Six Month Ad on a New Blog**

 

I realize you'd rather have a six month ad on Problogger, but I didn't write that one! Those of you who like contests and who don't mind taking a bit of a risk (your time only, not your gold) on a brand new venture may want to try pitching in to see if you can win a 6-month or 2-year ad at InkLit.com.

 

Here are the [Rules for the Ad Contest](http://www.inklit.com/blog/advertise/).

 

[Santa Clarita Real Estate Blogger, Linda Slocum](http://www.santaclaritarealestateblog.com), went above and beyond the call first by being the only commenter on this [cleverly re-titled post](http://realestatetomato.typepad.com/the_real_estate_tomato/2008/03/ask-for-a-guest.html).

 

Following up on this, she promoted the contest for me on FaceBook. I'm hoping to do well there. People with their face in a book are a natural for a writing blog!
