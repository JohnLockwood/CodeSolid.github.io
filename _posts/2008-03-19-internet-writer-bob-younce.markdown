If you're a writer working on the Internet, Bob Younce's [Writing Journey](http://writing-journey.com) is one of the blogs you should be reading.  I'm not saying this because Bob's blog is an easy read, though don't get me wrong, his style is fine.  Bob's blog can be a tough read because it's loaded with the kind of advice that makes you think "You know, darn it, he's right -- that is something I should be doing a better job at doing."  For example, his article [4 Keys to Establishing Your Brand as an Internet Writer](http://writing-journey.com/internet-writing/4-keys-to-establishing-your-brand-as-an-internet-writer) reminded me of the fact that this blog, Inklit, had yet to settle on what it wants to be when it grows up.  Am I writing for would-be Internet writers, sharing my journey from a one-client-wonder to a writer who's succeeding online?  Or am I changing the title tag to Internet Writer and going for the gusto as a search engine optimized sales piece?  Or am I just another ProBlogger wannabe [jamoke](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jamoke) with an AdSense account, a pink carnation and a pickup truck?

Another really great thing about Bob's blog is that unlike many blogs, it comes with Bob!    What distinguishes Bob from most of the writers out there is that he doesn't just write for the Internet -- he actually reads it as well.   Bob was one of the first people to come by, find my blog, and engage me in a conversation, and he makes a good case for establishing such peer relationships in his 4 Keys article.
