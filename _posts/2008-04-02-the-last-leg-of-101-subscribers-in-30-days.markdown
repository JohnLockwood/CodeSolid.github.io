I'm into the last 10-day leg of my 101 Subscribers in 30 Days promotion. I'm not as optimistic this time as I was last time, and my numbers have leveled off, at least in the short term. I picked up 34 subscribers in the first ten days, but from that point to today have added only nine more subscribers. As of today we're at 51 Subscribers.

I'm still pretty happy overall with the growth of the blog. After all, it's brand new, and just celebrated its one month birthday on April Fool's Day. All in all, an average of 202 visitors per day is good at this point.

 

By far the biggest contribution to the site's traffic to date is StumbleUpon, so again, thanks go out to Bob Younce for first submitting me there. Looks like he's going to win the ad without too much trouble at all **unless some superstar blogger visitor steps up.** Oh sorry, was that in bold?      
     
This traffic has slowed to a trickle in recent days, partly because I don't want to overdo stumbling myself.

 

Here's where most of the referrals are coming from:

http://activerain.com 21         
http://articlespecialist.blogspot.com 16         
http://www.problogger.net 14

 

About half of those Google referrals are from subsbcribers using the reader, the other half are from organic search and blog search. Like StumbleUpon, Entrecard has also slowed to a trickle since I'm not over there mindlessly clicking around. The problogger visits are just from a few comments -- pretty amazing.

 

I'm content to let the numbers grow organically from here on, even though I could probably make a concerted effort to land another tasty guest blogging spot and perhaps pull the numbers in by the skin of my teeth. To be honest, at this stage of the game I'm more interested in focusing in on some topics so I'll know what I'll do with those next fifty subscribers when I get them!

 

To all my current subscribers, thanks so much, and again, I'll try to keep some worthwhile stuff coming!
