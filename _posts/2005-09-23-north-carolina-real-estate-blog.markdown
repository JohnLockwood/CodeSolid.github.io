Now that's a nice approach if he can pull it off:  "We've partnered with the top NC realtors in each market to bring you a one-stop solution to finding homes in North Carolina."  See the blog at [http://nchomes.silkblogs.com](http://nchomes.silkblogs.com).


	

In other words:  put up a blog for the whole state, and then sell referrals.  I like the cut of his gib.


	

On the other hand, ouch.  I hate it when you get cut in the gib.


	

I was working on a directory to do something similar for California, but the solution seemed to point to a site that was too loaded up with computer-generated content, and I really hate that.  Also it occured to me that my main bread and butter to date was going after one and only one local market at a time.  


	

Having said that, I put up two web sites.


	

Some of us just are addicted to typing, I suspect.
