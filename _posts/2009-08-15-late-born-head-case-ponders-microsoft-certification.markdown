About every six months or so, I completely change platforms and direction in my software career.  That may be because I'm a head case, but if you read "How the Mind Works", you'll stumble upon the more charitable explanation that as the last born in my family my personality developed with a view to embracing change.

Charity begins at home.

I probably need to get certified, on some level.  I don't mean I need it or I won't have a job, per se, although it's the kind of thing that may open up opportunities around here.  As you might expect, the Sacramento programmer market has a lot of government work going on, and government hiring tends to be driven by the check box.  And of course, being the kind of late born head case that I am, I need to have more opportunities than if I were a conservative first born drudge.

I usually start thinking about certification in response to reaching a trough in fretting about my status.  (The wave itself runs perpetually.)  I have this relentless need to make some pathetic mark on the world, as if that could be done with a keyboard and a Microsoft Certification.  Perhaps fortunately, I'm generally able to suppress my ambition in order to grab whatever tarnished brass ring of a maintenance job happens to fly by my little software hobby horse of life.  It's a late born head case thing: we know how to make do with hand-me-downs, all the while secretly plotting to someday have our own pair of jeans for once.  As with pants, so with code.

Well, that was maudlin.  Both my older siblings were sisters, so the truth is I got my own clothes.  My parents were wonderful people, and like most folks they weren't about to go raising any _de facto_ transvestites.

Hey look, if you're a transvestite, nothing personal, OK?  Jeesh.

Anyway, if I make good on my threat, then I'll have something to write about.  No longer will I be working on a double secret probation Rails project where I can't share my code.  Instead, I'll be working on code so trivial in all but a pedagogical sense that only a Cheney-level paranoid would keep it in a man-sized office safe.

Meet the new blog.  Same as the old blog.
