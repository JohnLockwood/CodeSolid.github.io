Of course, now that I'm brushing off my software hat -- a four-prop beanie, presumably -- I'm opening Dr. Dobb's Journal when it comes in the mail.  The lastest edition talks about the buzz surrounding Ruby on Rails.

To be sure, there's a fair amount of hype in Dr. Dobbs about this language / enviornment.  Moreover,  quick search on Dice shows that it's a bit too early to declare it "Java's Successor" just yet.

To praphrase the Monkees, however:  "But then I saw the videos.  Now I'm a Believer".  Check out the [Ruby on Rails Screencasts ](http://www.rubyonrails.com/screencasts) for yourself.  Building a web log in 15 minutes was fun, but I especially liked "Evolving your database schema without a sweat".

This is seriously cool stuff, even if Java's still beating it by a clean 14370 keyword hits to 26.  What is this, some kind of popularity contest?

Well, for cash flow purposes at least:  Yep.
