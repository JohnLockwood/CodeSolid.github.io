Well, we're all having a great time on Houssee.  We're having so much fun that it's time for an update:



	
  * Lots of folks have been stopping by to visit.  Even though we're only eleven days old we have -- coincidentally enough -- 101 stories submitted or published, and 101 users.  Hey, this makes finding the average easy!

	
  * We've announced our first group of [Award Winners](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/06/houssee-real-estate-news-award-winners-1/), we have a [valuable prize](http://www.houssee.com/shirt.html) for them to win.

	
  * We have a written [Spam Policy](http://www.houssee.com/spam.php).  Don't Do It.

	
  * We now have our very own [blog](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/tag/housseecom/) (OK, so I admit it, technically it's a Wordpress tag on ParticleWave's very own blog -- but that's fun, too).  Hey look, you're reading it!

	
  * We have our own [FeedBurner Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HousseecomRealEstateNews/UpcomingNews) so you can keep track of the latest Houssee submissions.  So far we're feeding the submissions rather than the publications, but that may change soon when I announce the new algorithm for the top user sidebar.  Stay tuned.

	
  * We fixed an obscure technical problem, and got grouchy with a guy who was stubborn about it.  It's probably not interesting to you, but if you like obscure technical problems or seeing me grouchy, [read about it](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2008/06/07/problem-using-option-2-search-engine-friendly-urls-using-htaccess-in-pligg-with-fix/).

	
  * We have a [MyBlogLog account](http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/houssee/) for Houssee.  Don't look now, but your head is showing.
