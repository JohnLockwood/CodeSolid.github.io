I recently set as a goal for myself to learn all I can about depression and motivation.  This is because I found that as I actively began to examine my life and create goals for each area (i.e., take control of my destiny), I found this process very enjoyable and anti-depressing in nature.

I suffer from what (I believe) is mild depression.  So no need to send the marines out or anything -- I'm not going to cut my wrists with a sharp debugger or anything.

However, one of my first forays onto the internet brought this to light:





> One of the most insidious aspects of depression is that there is a tendency to attribute the symptoms to other factors in our lives. A lack of enjoyment, motivation or increased irritability at home may be considered to be due to a (possibly non-existent) problem with personal relationships. Similarly we may start to consider changing jobs believing that it is the external environment that is responsible when in fact it is a treatable illness affecting our interpretation of the external environment.

What often happens is that in looking to our environment to find the reasons for what are symptoms of an illness, we try to 'fix' things that are not broken which can have a very real destructive impact on our lives. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis and getting the most effective treatment for you, will make an enormous difference.




That's from the [Types of Depression](http://www.depressionet.com.au/sod/types.html) page over at DepressionNet.com.

Wow, bulls-eye.  Isn't that the story of my career over the last four years.

So then what can I say at this point about motivation and depression?  Not much, I'm just at the beginning of my inquiry, but I do know that I seem to feel best when creating my own life rather than suffering from it.  Yet it's the same set of external circumstances either way.
