I've put up my first free real estate content article.  It's here:

[Show Me a Five Dollar Bill, and I'll Show You Why Your Listing Expired](http://www.particlewave.com/freecontent/Expired101.php).

My goal is to do one a week, since this is the year I'm trying to get away from those silly looking little link directories, but in the meantime I need to find some way for the search engines to find me.

I'll do another post soon about some of the resources I find useful as I dig further into article submission.  One that's already been somewhat helpful and generated a few ideas is [SubmitYourArticle.com](http://www.submityourarticle.com).  They're web site is pretty much an opt-in email list, but so far it's pretty much been just good solid information.  I'm not at the point of recommending their article submission services yet, however.  I'm still looking at many of the folks out there writing, and trying to understand how much their writing helps their search positions, but I'm somewhat wary of the effect of automated services given the web's history with link submission services and the like.  If anyone's used SubmitYourArticle.com or another article submission service and wants to be interviewed, let me know.
