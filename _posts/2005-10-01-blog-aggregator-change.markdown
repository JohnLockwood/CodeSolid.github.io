I'm almost certainly going to change the behavior of the aggregator soon so if you're wondering where your links and summaries went, that's where.  I have the cron job that automated the aggregator turned off in the meantime.

Clearly this site is getting made up whole clots as we go along.

That was originally a typo for "whole cloth", but whole clots sounded closer to the truth so we'll let it go.
