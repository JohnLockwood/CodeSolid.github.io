From the [Buddhist Blog](http://thebuddhistblog.blogspot.com/), we learn about some excellent [podcasts](http://www.dpcast.org/) from the Deer Park Monastery.  While listening to one of these, the Heart Sutra was sung beautifully, leading me to look a little further into the idea of emptiness is form, and form is emptiness.  Google was good enough to lead me to this excellent article on [Emptiness is Form](http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html).

Very tasty.
