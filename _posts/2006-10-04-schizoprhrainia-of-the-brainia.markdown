There was a cartoon once in which a character was accused by some mad doctor type of having "Schizophrenia of the Brainia" -- I put up a variant spelling above so you can see how to pronounce it.

Probably it was a Flintstones episode.  I was glued to those as a kid.

It's in the spirit of schizophrenia of the brainia that I reflect today on my web site and blog here.  On the one hand I have a personal blog that's kind of fun, about Buddhism and Depression and what-note that I feel like what-noting.  On the other hand, I really want to use this prime "internet marketing real estate" to talk about (and sell) "internet real estate marketing" as a service.  Pardon the clever use of dyslexia.

But schizophrenia / multiple personality disorder isn't really the metaphor I'm going for.  The goal of a doctor treating a patient with multiple personality disorder is to get them to become re-integrated.  But the goal of doctor me in treating this multiple personality web site, unless I miss my guess, should be to disintegrate it into two separate blogs.
