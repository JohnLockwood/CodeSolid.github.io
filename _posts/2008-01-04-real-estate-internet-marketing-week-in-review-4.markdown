**_Find Ways to Use These Groaning Resources![Real Estate Internet Marketing Week In Review](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/image.png)_**

 

It's time for the Week In Review, so I'll publish Part III of Twenty-One Easy Real Estate Blog Posts on Monday.

 

This week I found a new tool to help me gather my Week In Review links, [Awasu](http://www.awasu.com) (Gesundheit!). Awasu is a very slick -- if, at times, somewhat buggy -- RSS feed reader for Windows. I'll probably have an in depth review in a future post.

 

Pet peeve time: People who use "Blog" to mean a single post on a Blog. These are no doubt the same people who say Real-a-tor.

 

This week's Web 2.0 "There Must Be Something We Can Do With All These Web Sites" award goes to John Jantsch at Duct Tape Marketing for his brief [Let's Get More Social](http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2008/01/03/lets-get-more-social/ ) article. Sometimes I think Social Networks should be the butt of the joke we used to tell in college about sociology -- that it's a subject in search of a subject matter. As John says, "You've got to get in there and find ways to use these growing resources." (Right -- because it sure ain't obvious).

 

On the other extreme, the winner of this week's "The Heck With That, I'm Growing My Own Resources" award is Elite Properties' own [Sacramento Real Estate Gal, Purva Brown](http://www.sacramentorealestategal.com/), who graciously calls me a mentor even though most of her success is just from getting in there and learning and making things happen. Purva just escaped the Google sandbox yesterday and is now appearing on page 2 of Google for a keyword combination with 725,000 competitors. Not bad for six months! Go Purva!

 

In other Web 2.0 news, Bruce Clay's web site scared the tar out of me when I glanced at an article [Why Social Media](http://www.bruceclay.com/blog/archives/2007/07/why_social_medi.html). Bruce is a very renowned SEO expert, so if he's telling you to yank your YouTube [I can't believe he said that], part time luddites like me are in a heap of trouble. It turns out the article was by a guest author, so it looks like I dodged a bullet for this week.

 

New reader and fellow Real Estate Marketing author Tim O'Keefe throws a much needed [wet blanket](http://www.houseblogger.com/houseblogger/2008/01/active-rain.html) on the often lightless fire of ActiveRain.

 

Back in the heady world of experimentation, this week social networking for Realtors super-trailblazers [Ashley Drake Gephart](http://www.ashleysellshouses.com/aboutashley.html) and [Bill Gassett](http://www.sellmyhomeinmetrowestma.com) invited me to a new business social network, [Konnect.com](http://www.konnects.com/profile/JohnLockwood/ ). Social network #1,327, please fix your search engine if you want to be taken seriously before the Internet moves on to the next big thing.

 

You should be reading [this guy](http://www.jimboykin.com), if you're not already.

 

Do you need a free ratings widget for your blog? Chances are good that you don't. No link for you, [Outbrain](http://www.outbrain.com). (Doh!)

 

Meantime for those of you who are not content with these mere seven-day retrospectives, Tamar Weinberg has prepared a list of [2007's Best Internet Marketing Blog Posts](http://www.techipedia.com/2007/internet-marketing-best-blog-posts), hat tip to [Andy Beard](http://andybeard.eu/2007/12/marketing-resources.html). Those of you who feel compelled to take on John Jantsch's challenge to "find ways to use these growing resources", please work your way through the list and report back. Hey, come to think of it, Ashley and Bill should be guest authors here...
