America's Number One Blog Directory doesn't look like much yet, does it?  And it isn't much yet.  So why did you get here?  Because this directory is rising phoenix-like from the ashes of a fairly well-promoted site of ours, our old software development web site, ParticleWave.

In the days ahead we'll have new posts about real estate blogging and be cleaning up our act generally, but if you're a real estate blogger and early adopter, feel free to call us at the number above and we'll get you on our blog roll for the time being.

And oh, yeah, we'll be writing the blog direrectory software, too.  Minor detail.
