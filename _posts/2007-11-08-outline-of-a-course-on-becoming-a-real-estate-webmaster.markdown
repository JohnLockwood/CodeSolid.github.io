I have several screencasts and blogs planned around some topics in mastering Internet marketing for real estate agents, and lately have been considering offering some of this material initially on the blog, but with the eventual goal of organizing and expanding it into a course of study in real estate Internet marketing.

The course would be for those who want hands-on experience building a very low cost web site.  It would be for people who want to not only save lots of money by free (or low cost), tools and vendors, and who want to understand Internet marketing in enough depth to know what to do and what to avoid.  The goal will be to equip you with enough information to make Internet marketing a major or a primary source of your real estate income.

Here's a preliminary course outline.



	
  1. Understanding where we're going.  A roadmap for success.

	
  2. Internet Business Planning, including two or more complete business plans for successful Internet marketing.

	
  3. Researching key words.  Find the right major and minor key words.  Striking the right balance between search volume and competitiveness.

	
  4. Search Engine Optimization basics.  White hat all the way.  What to do and what to avoid.

	
  5. Registering your domain name and setting up hosting.  (Should also include material on how to use the course with an existing domain name.)

	
  6. Building your webmaster toolbox.  Find and install free tools to help you make money without spending much.

	
  7. Installing your Wordpress blog, Part I.  Up and Running.

	
  8. Installing your Wordpress blog, Part II.  Using Wordpress to manage your entire web site.

	
  9. Customizing Wordpress.  Plug-ins and themes.

	
  10. Promoting your blog I:  First steps.

	
  11. Blogging made easy I:  Free blogging tools.  Working with text.

	
  12. Blogging made easy II:  Photos and advanced topics.

	
  13. Blogging made easy III:  What to write, when to write, and what to expect.

	
  14. Promoting your blog II:  Using social networks effectively.

	
  15. Your real estate "killer offer":  understanding IDX.

	
  16. Let your users search, Integrating IDX.

	
  17. Time or money?  Using pay-per-click advertising effectively.

	
  18. Measuring results:  use free tools to analyze your visitor behavior.

	
  19. New visitors are good.  Repeat visitors are great.  Get them to keep coming back.

	
  20. Improving conversion rates.  Turning visitors into customers.  Working with Internet buyers.

	
  21. Dominating your market.  From knowledge to mastery.


Now all I need is a few hundred hours with no interruptions and getting it done will be easy.
