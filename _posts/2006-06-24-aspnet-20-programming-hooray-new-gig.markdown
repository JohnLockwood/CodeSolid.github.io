I'm grateful to my good friends at Robert Half for the exciting gig we're working on now, developing in ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005.  I'm very excited to be stepping back into the contract software labor force after a few years putting up web sites and selling houses, and getting back into using Microsoft's tool set is exciting as well since many of my last major contracts were either Java (which is fine too) or ASP using Delphi -- which is a bit too exotic and unmainstream for my taste.  I like a little job security.

Actually, after real estate, I wouldn't mind a LOT of job security, which is why I'm seriously considering just doing .NET alone for the foreseeable future.  Java's cool enough, but I don't think it would hurt my current prospects to maybe do some certifications -- and it would certainly help my current client if I threw myself into some spare time .NET hacking in preparation for those certifications, even if in the end I decide the certifications themselves are a superfluous expense.

So don't be surprised if a lot of what you read here in the months ahead ends up being about the Road to [.NET 2.0 Certification](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/webapps/).

Stay tuned.
