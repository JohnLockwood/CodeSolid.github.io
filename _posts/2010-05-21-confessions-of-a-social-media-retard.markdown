Lately I’ve been really trying to blog more and Twitter more and FaceBook more.

 

I’m not sure why yet. I thnk I might be selling something someday, but I’m not sure what. This is probably how people should sell on social media, rather gently. There’s a company near here that I added to my friends on Twitter, because they asked an interesting question or two about the area, and their first response was to send me a private message with “How can we help you with your [company business related] needs?”

 

Well, you can’t, really, I was just saying hello.

 

On the other end of the spectrum, I noticed that Jay Thompson has thousands of followers. That guy is everywhere. And he doesn’t sell, but if I had a referral I’d give it to him, because I know who he is. He’s very nice.

 

On the non-business side of the spectrum we have Purva Brown. Purva just enjoys Facebook and talks about what she likes to talk about, and has a good time. I admire that.

 

Even though I’m trying hard to feel my way around the whole Web 2.0 phenomenon, the core problem I have is threefold:

 

  
  * As often as not, I have nothing (or very little) to say. 
   
  * I have a really hard time just going out there and saying nothing, because people who update me on the kind of trivial details that I generally have in stock bore the daylights out of me, and I don’t want to inflict that on others. 
   
  * I don’t take a lot of pictures. I don’t know why. I have a nice camera. 
 

I think to be really successful at social media, you have to be just confident enough in yourself to blab at the mouth a lot, yet not so egotistical that you feel the need to have something to say.

 

Take this post.

 

Please.
