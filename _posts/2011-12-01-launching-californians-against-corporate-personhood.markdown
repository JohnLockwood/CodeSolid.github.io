**We Need Your Help**

Today I launched Californians Against Corporate Personhood.

For those of you who like success stories of big fights won by organizations with modest beginnings, you're in the right place, because we're as modest as it gets -- one guy, no budget.

What we are going to accomplish is a big fight, to be sure.  The process of amending the constitution to eliminate the idea of corporations as people is we need to accomplish is spelled out in Article 5 of the Constitution:


> The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress...


Already there are a number of organizations working on this on a national level, and part of what we'll be doing is coordinating and cooperating with those that appear to have the best chance of moving the agenda forward.  My opinion so far is that this will turn out to be [United Republic](http://unitedrepublic.org) ([@unitedrep](http://twitter.com/#unitedrep)) since among the organizations scrambling to put the energy unleashed by the occupy movement to good account, they seem to be the best organized.

To help Cenk Uygur get organized I just wrote to him about his [Wolf-Pac](http://www.wolf-pac.com/) when he mentioned he needs an executive director.   Long-shot job application much?  Oh well, no balls no blue chips as the saying goes.  If I get hired as Wolf-Pac's Executive Director, I'll take back all that stuff I said about United Republic being more organized -- because I'll make it not be true.

Anyway, my point in launching Californians Against Corporate Personhood is that it may turn out that the only way that I can make a significant contribution to this effort is to take it to the state level.  With three fourths of the states needed to ratify this and 2/3 of them needing to come on board either in Congress or at the State Legislatures just to get the party started, we'll need a guy in California.

Some next steps:



	
  * Try to organize the fragmented information that's available online.  There are probably at least a dozen online petitions circulating by now, and not less than [three proposals](http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_65/Advocacy-Groups-Seek-to-Curb-Corporations-210594-1.html?pos=hln) by three different Democratic House members.

	
  * Start developing a committed group of activists in California who can work on offline petitions, meetings with state and federal representatives, and other forms of direct action.

	
  * Start approaching Occupy Wall Street centers throughout California.

	
  * Work on arguments and messages that will appeal to the right.  They need to see that crony capitalism is not free market capitalism, and the job creators they love so much need to spend their time creating jobs and not interfering with the people's business.

	
  * Work respectfully and try to practice Gandhi-style ahisma (non-violence) with everyone I meet and work with.


Please write to me about your views on this and contact me to volunteer.  Government of the people, by the people, and for the people has to start with the right definition of who the people are.  (Hint -- if you're reading this, you are.  Your company isn't, but your boss is.  It's so simple it took the Supreme Court 200 years to fully screw it up).
