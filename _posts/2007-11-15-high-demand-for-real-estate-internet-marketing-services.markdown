The last few days I've been getting a steady flow of traffic to the site.  There haven't been as many subscribers as I'd like to have yet, but in general I've been hearing from a lot of people and getting a few nice "keep up the good work emails."

Even more encouraging, especially as I'm starting to talk about possible service offerings like my is the number of calls I've been getting from people who already have a real estate blog that they've purchased from another vendor and who've been picking my brain for solutions to problems the other vendor doesn't provide.

A few things have become obvious in the course of these discussions:



	
  * People are paying more than they should for separate web sites and blogging solutions.  Given that I run several sites that successfully integrate IDX and Wordpress blogs, and given that I'm an IHomefinder reseller, I can compete on cost and still provide an excellent product.

	
  * People are also paying a huge amount just to learn how to blog.  Now granted, if you're non-technical, there are some skills that need to be mastered, but I believe you can do a lot of this online with some combination of 1) the right tutorials and 2) online teleconferencing courses.


The other thing that's also helping me sharpen up my service offerings has been thinking through some of the parts of my outline of a [Real Estate Webmaster Training Course](http://www.particlewave.com/internet-marketing/2007/11/08/outline-of-a-course-on-becoming-a-real-estate-webmaster/).  As I was doing this, it became pretty apparent that I was probably getting into far too much depth on certain issues in my zeal to create a sort of "Help-U-Sell (Online)" discount model.

I probably had this "Every-Agent-A-Webmaster" zeal as an overreaction to that nagging question that I keep thinking about:  You paid **HOW MUCH** **AGAIN **to learn how to use Wordpress ? ! ?

Probably there's a way to cook this porridge so that it's neither too hot nor to cold.

PS:  It turns out I _have _had [porridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge).  It's just oatmeal.  Who knew?
