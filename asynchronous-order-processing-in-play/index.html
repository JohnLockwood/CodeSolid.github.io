            <h1>Asynchronous Order Processing in Play - A Proof of Concept</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">12 Dec 2014</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>There&#39;s a project at a company I know that I thought would be a great fit for a Play application. For reasons too complex to go into here, no one will be working on this application any time soon, but to me it&#39;s still a simple but interesting problem.  The gist of the thing is this:</p>

<p>The company has a service that handles orders for [top secret thing].  This service has some limitations.  First, it writes the order request into a database in real time, then a separate process running hourly on a different system reads the orders and sends them to a partner for processing.  The output of the second process is opaque to our customers -- i.e., there&#39;s not a separate service that allows them to retrieve the status of an order.</p>

<p>Obviously an application like this is rife for improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Minimally, the team could expose an endpoint to report the status of the order.  Yes, the order wouldn&#39;t be ready for up to an hour or more after it&#39;s submitted, but at least the customer could check the status without calling support.</p></li>
<li><p>Better yet, rather than batching orders to our third party vendor we could send them as they&#39;re received, and return a result as soon as we get it.  Of course, the downstream server is not under our control, it might be out of commission, etc., so we&#39;d want to store enough information locally to be able to resend the order if it fails.  Picking a number out of a hat, the team&#39;s manager suggested that orders would be processed in ten seconds, rather than hourly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, ten seconds is still an eternity if you&#39;re a user who just clicked the submit button, so taking the idea a bit further and using Play / Akka for the solution, a few ideas come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once submitted, the order should be &quot;received&quot; (i.e. written to our &quot;local&quot; datastore) as soon as possible.  This could still be an asynchronous request, of course, the response should be less than 100ms after the request is received.  Cassandra could do this in a walk, but MySQL could easily handle our volume as well.</p></li>
<li><p>If the partner that process the order is down / overloaded, etc., we should be able to report a possible delay to the user as soon as possible.  The <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/common/circuitbreaker.html">akka circuit breaker</a> pattern provides an elegant solution to this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The order status page should update itself in real time if possible.  Some alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>WebSocket on modern browsers, but degrade to F5 to refresh status on older browsers.</li>
<li>Comet sockets everywhere.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, I need to better understand best practices for WebSocket / Comet services, since this idea may be untenable.  A proof of concept may be easy to stand up in Play, but our client almost certainly will not be a Play app, so the order status information needs to be available as a stateless service endpoint as well).  Probably at minimum we need <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jquery-graceful-websocket/">Graceful Web Sockets</a> in there, and probably another trick or two.</p>

<p>I started working on some code for this while waiting for someone to show up at the first meeting of the <a href="http://ScalaUserGroup.org">ScalaUserGroup.org</a>, and inasmuch as nobody did, I made pretty good progress! I may post the code soon if I can make it generic enough to protect the innocent.</p>
