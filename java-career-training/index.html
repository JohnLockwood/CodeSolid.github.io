            <h1>Java Career Training</h1>
<!-- <p class="meta">20 Dec 2014</p> -->

<div class="post">
<p>When I began putting together Java training courses, I thought about what training opportunities were out there in the market already, and naturally I began to reflect on how I began my own programming career some twenty-four years ago, and some of the successes I&#39;ve had since then. I also thought about programmers I&#39;d interviewed through the years and the things my colleagues and I talked about after the programming interview to decide if the candidate was a good fit or not.</p>

<p>One of the things that I realized almost immediately is that the benefits the schools were trying to sell (such as being a &quot;Certified Programmer&quot;) were not bad things in their own right, but they might not be the quickest way for you to reach your goal. A certificate is not a bad thing to get. Depending on the provider it means you learned something, or sat through a course, or passed a test, and that person certifies (states that it&#39;s true) that you&#39;re a programmer. But in all the interviews I&#39;ve ever been in, on both sides of the table, being certified was far less important than having some kind of experience. </p>

<h2>The Road to Experience</h2>

<p>Now at this point you may be thinking, &quot;Well, that&#39;s great for you to say because you&#39;ve been doing this for twenty-four years, but look, I don&#39;t have any experience
as a programmer.&quot;</p>

<p>So if experience is the most important thing you can bring to the interview, and you don&#39;t have experience, what do you need to do?  You need to give yourself the experience.  How do you do that?  Well, you do it by programming. You learned to walk by crawling and pulling yourself up on the edge of a couch and falling down, and before you know it your poor tired mom was chasing you all over the place and complaining to her friends that you had too much energy.</p>

<p>Did the fastest professional athlete you can think of learn to walk the same way you did? Sure they did. Now, did they get to be professionals athletes by becoming &quot;Certified Athletes?&quot; Of course not, in athletics the very idea sounds ridiculous. Professional athletes get to be professional athletes by first becoming great amateur athletes, and they get to be great amateur athletes by practicing a lot. They want it, and they have coaches who help and push and encourage them, and above all they practice a lot.</p>

<p>My first few programming resume had a line on it that went something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;Undertook a course of self study in C and C++ consisting of 25,000 lines of sample applications.&quot;</p>

<p>Was I a professional programmer at that point? Not yet. But I could bring code samples to an interview. It took me three years of self study, while holding down a full time job and starting a family. But every day I practiced a bit, reading books like &quot;C: Step by Step&quot; during lunch and writing a few more sample applications in the morning or evening to add to my &quot;line count&quot;.</p>

<h2>Flattening the Learning Curve</h2>

<p>As a professional programmer with twenty-four years of experience, I wanted to share what I&#39;d learned over the years.  Most of all, I wanted to help professionals begin (or upgrade) their programming career in the fastest, most time-effective way possible. This is why I began working on a course of study that was focused on building practical skills and techniques that would help you become a better programmer -- faster.  In addition to core Java skills, I also wanted to teach you how to use many of the related tools that:</p>

<ol>
<li> Show up all the time on job descriptions (because they&#39;re what real Java programmers use every day on the job).</li>
<li> You can use to build and deploy a portfolio that point to in order to help you actually land a job.</li>
</ol>

<p>Above all I wanted my students to graduate from my courses with a portfolio of relevant work, not a certificate.  There are enough people out there who&#39;ll sell you a Java certificate, and it&#39;s not that you won&#39;t learn something along the way, but I wanted the focus of my company to be on using professional tools in a professional context.</p>

<p>I know how important career development is -- for me it meant being able to finally pay off those student loans, get myself out of debt, and lead a comfortable existence. While other students are saying &quot;Here&#39;s my certificate&quot;, I want the students who trust me to be a part of that process to be able to sit across from their interviewer and say:  &quot;Here, click on this URL, it&#39;ll bring you to the web site I developed using Java and Spring. This is running on Amazon EC2. It&#39;s still a work in progress but it shows some basic principles. And here&#39;s a link to the code on Github and some other code I&#39;ve been working on.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on those interviews, on the side worrying about whether I&#39;d get the job as well as on the side making the decision about someone else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always the one with the code who gets hired.</p>
